         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Proteſtant Reader.</head>
            <p>WHenſoever it pleaſes the Almighty Goodneſs to enlighten with the glorious beams of Divine Truth thoſe who ſit in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death in ſo powerful a manner, as that forſaking the perplexed labyrinth of Errors, they betake themſelves for repoſe and ſafety into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> 'tis Satan's policy by his Agents to make the World believe that the motives of their Converſion were but weak and carnal, leaſt others ſhould follow their example.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:200329:3"/>
            <p>Herein I have been as deeply cenſur'd as others, to whom God has vouchſafed the like extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mercy: Yet truly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever calumnies have hereupon been caſt upon me by ſome who have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd Spirits, and Hearts ſwoln with rancour againſt the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my ſelf, I ſhould for many reaſons bave contentedly ſat down in ſilence, rejoycing in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good Conſcience, if the good of thoſe, upon whom my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion may have moſt influence, had not in charity oblig'd me to refuſe no pains that might afford them help or ſatisfaction in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the higheſt nature and concernment.</p>
            <p>This was the preſſing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which at laſt prevailed
<pb facs="tcp:200329:3"/> with me to give theſe Motives of my Converſion a publick beeing, and common air to breath in; that their own eyes might be Judges, what juſt cauſe I had to change my Religion, and how much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is for them to follow me.</p>
            <p>Of which I conceive great hopes, when to me it ſeems impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any prudential man, who ſeriouſly enters into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grounds of Chriſtian belief, with a Soul wholly diveſted of all prejudices and ſelf-intereſts whatſoever, earneſtly imploring the Divine aſſiſtance and direction; I ſay, it ſeems to me impoſſible for any prudential man in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, not at laſt to diſcover the truth of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and acknowledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the only high-road
<pb facs="tcp:200329:4"/> to Heaven and Happineſs, he will hear a Divine voice whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering<note place="margin">Jerim. 16. 16.</note> to him, <hi>This is the old path, walk in it, and thou ſhalt find reſt unto thy Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus by Gods bleſſing I ſought, and this reſt at last I found; and never found it, 'till after much pains and ſtudy, after many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Tears, after many Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Watchings, after many toſſings and turnings, after many ſad delays and expoſtulations, after many conflicts and agonies in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, my reſolutions by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workings of Grace on my Soul breaking through all difficulties, did effectually bring me into the arms of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which I ſaw no reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect any deluſion, when my moſt ſerious reflections paſs d judgment
<pb facs="tcp:200329:4"/> on it; ſeeing this happy change was not wrought in me by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perſuaſion, but the God of Truth, did by his immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations begin this work of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on my Soul, when, having no thoughts at all of becoming a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and finding much bitterneſs in the ways of ſin and worldly vanities, I was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſeeking of God, what courſe I might beſt take how to pleaſe him, and ſave my precious and immortal Soul.</p>
            <p>But to prevent all fear of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, pretended illuminations and falſe lights, (wherewith many poor Souls in our Nation are ſo miſerably miſled) God who is as well eſſential Reaſon as Goodneſs, did not only move my Will, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo rationally convince my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:200329:5"/> that all Communions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Christ beſide the <hi>Roman,</hi> were more or leſs erroneous, and ſhe only the true <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> according to the conſtant notion of Antiquity, out of which ordinarily Salvation was not to be expected. And therefore I muſt flie to her, as to the ſaving Ark, that I might not periſh in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of my ſins.</p>
            <p>So then this change in me was not a paſſionate diſtortion of an intereſſed will, puſhing forward the blind underſtanding to fix ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and adhere pertinaciouſly to more then the light of reaſon did clear up to the eye of the Soul, but undoubtedly <hi>mutatio dexterae Excelſi,</hi> the work of God wrought in my heart by convincing arguments, as the following Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb facs="tcp:200329:5"/> do ſufficiently evidence.</p>
            <p>Nor could it be to ſatisfy the inclinations of ſenſual nature, when I was to forſake my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, my Friends, my Temporal Revenues and Preferments, and all worldly contentments; to take up my Croſs and follow Jeſus by contempt of the world, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual practice of ſelf-denyal and mortification. And happy is he, who had rather have a Croſs with Chriſt, than a Crown without him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Father of Mercies was graciouſly pleas'd by an efficacious call to bring his Prodigal Son Home; For his Church is his Houſe, where he dwells among his Saints on earth with his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence, to govern and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them all things condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to their happineſs. From
<pb facs="tcp:200329:6"/> which houſhold of Faith I was an Alien, while I was a Member of the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> which ſtands dis joynted from <hi>Catholick</hi> Unity by a <hi>Schiſm</hi> too notorious to be justified. And until we (like true Penitents) return unto our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church which made us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we like Prodigals feeding on ratling Husks of formal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, without any ſubſtantial nouriſhment to our Souls, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably miſpend our precious time, on which inevitably depends E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</p>
            <p>And this ſhall ſuffice by way of Preface for an Introduction. The door is open, enter, and view well the Motives, and the eternal Sun of righteouſneſs, who is the true Light of the World, open thine eyes to ſee, and guide thy feet into the way of Peace.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:200329:6"/>
            <p>Yet before the Lecture, I thought good to adviſe whoſoever ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe theſe Papers, that bere is not to be expected that variety of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which may be found in more Judicious Controvertiſts; but a true Narrative of what principal Motives prevail'd with me to forſake <hi>Proteſtaniſm,</hi> and yield my ſelf into the Arms of our Mother Church. And yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they are ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the ableſt Heads, if they have but hearts reſolved to yield to Truth.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe tell thee good Reader, that theſe Motives had long ſince ſeen the light, if ſome accidental occaſions had not retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their birth into the World. However, though they loſt their choiceſt ſeaſon of publication, which
<pb facs="tcp:200329:7"/> is, when ſuch Converſions are moſt freſh in memory, yet 'twas thought fit by perſons as well ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious as zealous, that they ſhould by no means live any longer in obſcurity, but be ſet upon a Candleſtick in the Houſe of God, to give light to others; and I did acquieſae in their judgment, and was content to have them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd for the common good. Read them Impartially, conſider them Seriouſly, and practice Faithfully what God ſhall inſpire into thy Soul. And remember in thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</p>

                     <p>That the two chief externe Grounds or Motives of Credibility leading to the Truth of what Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught the World, are <hi>Univerſal Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Church Authority.</hi>

                  <p>GOD who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpoke unto the Fathers by his Prophets; laſt of all in the fulneſs of Time reveal'd his Will unto us by his Son: So that the Word was made Fleſh, not only as a Saviour to lay down his own Life for our Redemption, and Suffer for us, but alſo as a Law-giver to inſtruct us what we muſt believe, and do for his ſake and our own good, if we will be ſav'd. Before this laſt and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200329:11"/> perfect revelation of all ſupernatural means to attain to Life, deliver'd to the World by Chriſt; the <hi>Jews</hi> were the peculiar people of God, their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue the true Church, and their Ceremonial Rights the True Worſhip, inſtituted by God himſelf, to continue in force during that Pedagogie. But the eternal Sun of Righteouſneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, thoſe Shadows were in him fulfill'd, and ſo vaniſh'd to give place unto the Goſpel, whoſe glorious Beams were to Enlighten thoſe that ſat in Darkneſs, and the ſhadow of Death, to the uttermoſt Corners of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon there being a change of the Law, it was neceſſary there ſhould be a Tranſlation of the Prieſthood alſo, (the time being now come foretold by <hi>Malachy, That from the riſing of the Sun to the going down thereof, Gods Name ſhould be great among the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and they ſhould Sacrifice in every place, and</hi>

                  <p>This Church of Chriſt, as it is one body, ſo likewiſe it was of one heart and of one mind, while Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical purity remain'd unſpotted.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200329:12"/> But never more then in theſe laſt and perillous days, which ſince <hi>Luther</hi>'s Apoſtacy from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have produc'd ſuch an innumerable brood of New Goſpels and Sects; all pretending to believe and practice thoſe Doctrines and that Worſhip, which were taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and to be the only true Church of God, or at leaſt the pureſt Members of it.</p>
                  <p>Now it being acknowledg'd on all hands, that they only are the true Church, who believe and obſerve all points taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles neceſſary to Salvation, and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, contrary Beliefs and Worſhips ſhould be all true, and come from the Fountain of Truth, Chriſt Jeſus, thoſe whom a more ſerious deſire and care of their Eternal Good may excite to ſeek for ſatisfaction in ſo important a buſineſs, ſhall upon diligent inquiſition, by the bleſſing of God, find, that the chief externe grounds or evidence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by Chriſt for the guiding us in the knowledge of what was taught and left by him, to be believ'd and practis'd to the Worlds end; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alſo for diſcerning which is the

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Preparatory Diſcourſe to <hi>Church-Tradition.,</hi> and what it is.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THo' whoſoever examines aright the Motives of Chriſtian belief, cannot rationally but become a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> that is, find evidence how he may come to the certain knowledge of what Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught the World; yet Faith is not grounded on Reaſon, but Authority; and that no leſs then Divine, which excludes all poſſibility of Errour. Whatever it is that brings men to know what they muſt believe, Faith hath for its formal Object Divine Revelation, into which it finally is reſolv'd. So that we believe nothing as of Faith, but what is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and becauſe it is revealed by Eſſential Verity, who can neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor be deceived. <hi>Catholicks</hi> then believe by Divine Faith, Truths only revealed by Almighty God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Proteſtants</hi> agree with us. But <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> believe the ſame Truths as they are aſcertained, declar'd and handled
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:200329:13"/> down to us by the Teſtimony of the Church, wherein <hi>Protestants</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; the difference thefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us in Faith, ariſes chiefly from hence, in that we uſe not the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne <hi>Medium</hi> to convey unto our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings the knowledge of what Truths are revealed, and what not. For could we once agree about this latter, we ſhould ſoon be of one Heart, and of one mind in all points of Faith, eſpecially when once this <hi>Medium</hi> is proved to be infallible.</p>
                  <p>As to this <hi>Medium</hi> therefore <hi>Catholicks</hi> regulate their Faith by the Rule or Standard of <hi>Tradition</hi> and Church-Authority as the externe Proponent of Faith, a Proponent alſo evidenced to them by the ſame Rule to be Infallible, and thus they ſafely rely on the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Tradition and Church. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Declaring and Expounding both the Senſe of Scripture, and all other Chriſtian Miſteries neceſſary to Salvation. Whilſt on the contrary, <hi>Protestants</hi> relying on the ſole expreſs Texts of Scripture, interpreted by private Reaſon or Spirit, as their only Rule and Guide in matters of Faith, become unſteady in their Belief, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:200329:14"/> to dangerous Errors, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongſt themſelves into endleſs Sects and Factions. But becauſe a more clear underſtanding of this matter in ſome ſort depends on a right notion of Tradition, we ſhall here define it in the ſenſe it is uſually underſtood by <hi>Catholick</hi> Divines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tradition</hi> then is the delivery of that Doctrine which was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, from hand to hand, deſcending as ſuch from Fathers to their Children, making up the body of the Faithful. This is the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tradition among us <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and it matters not whether it be call'd Divine, Apoſtolical, or Univerſal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the ſame thing expreſt by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers adjuncts: For it is call'd Divine, becauſe Chriſt our Lord, as well true God as true man, is the Spring-head of it. It is call'd Apoſtolical, becauſe the Apoſtles immediately receiv'd from him things ſo deliver'd, and Preach'd them to all Nations. And Univerſal, becauſe Atteſted by the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church of all Ages to have been han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to her as originally proceeding from Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And to prevent all miſtakes, let <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:200329:14"/> take notice that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſends not her Children on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſearch for what is Divine or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Tradition in matters of Faith and Diſcipline out of the Writings of the Fathers, or other Libraries of Books fill'd with dead Words, which are ſubject to various Interpretations by Critical heads, without any hope of Agreement; and can have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity dependent on Tradition; (though upon this account ſhe has infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt all other Communions in the World, to juſtify her Faith and practice, in any unbyaſs'd Judgments.) But ſends them to a viſible, living Oracle, Oral Tradition, that is, the voice of the preſent Church, atteſting that what ſhe teaches as of Faith, ſhe ſo received from the Age immediately foregoing, and ſo from Age to Age, from Millions of Sons to their Fathers, up to the Apoſtles, and the Sacred Mouth of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>From Church-Tradition thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, briefly may be drawn thoſe Poſitions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Doctrine taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, compriſes all points neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:200329:15"/>
                  <p>Secondly, That all ſuch points taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles have been continued in the Church from believing Fathers to their Children, by an un-interrupted ſucceſſion, without Diminution or Addition, and ſhall ſo continue for ever. Which involves theſe two Propoſitions; that nothing comes to us upon the tenure of Faith but what is of Tradition. (Yea, though contain'd in Scripture, ſeing we only are aſcertain'd what Books the Apoſtles wrote, and what is the true ſenſe of them, by Tradition.) And that there are no new points of Faith in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, <hi>quoad Substantiam,</hi> as to the ſubſtance of what is reveal'd; the preſent Church only believing what it received from precedent Ages. Which aſſertion whoſoever oppoſes, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts not me, but the Sublime Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctor St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> expreſly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in <hi>Doctrina Chriſti &amp; Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>22ae. 1 q. ar. 10. ad 1am. &amp; 2am. Et in 1a. par. q. 32. ar. 4. corp.</hi> In the Doctrin of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Truth of Faith is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently unfolded; but becauſe perverſe men pervert the Doctrin of the Apoſtles and other Doctrines and Scriptures, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:200329:15"/> their own Deſtruction, as is ſaid in the 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the laſt Chap. Therefore the explication of Faith was neceſſary againſt ariſing Errors in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, not containing another Faith, but the ſame more clear'd.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or handing of Chriſtian Doctrin by oral Teaching, and viſible practice of the Chriſtian World, is, and was the conſtant Rule of Faith, as well after as before the Scriptures were written, and received by the Church.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Theſis</hi> or Poſition, though it hath been deny'd by ſome Hereticks, as namely the <hi>Montaniſts;</hi> yet is not controverted between us and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> The proof lies upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; which being demonſtrated, the third will follow of it ſelf, and cannot be deny'd with ſhow of Reaſon.</p>

                  <p>NO other externe prudential evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or aſſurance in matters of Divine Faith, (whoſe efficient Cauſe is Divine Grace,) is neceſſarily requir'd, then a Moral certainty, that what is propos'd to be believ'd as of Faith, is the very ſame Doctrin which was taught by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. Which aſſurance neither is, nor can be had among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who build their new Church upon their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and unſteady Interpretations of Scripture: But is manifeſtly to be found in that Communion of Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which grounds its Faith as to ſuch evidence, upon Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition; a Principle not well lyable to Error, and therefore cannot rationally be expected to fail thoſe who relie upon it.

                  <p>Chriſtian Religion is ſupernatural, deſcending from Heaven to us by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; that is, ſuch a one, as is not to be learn'd but from Almighty God and his Miſſioners; namely from Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and ſo ſucceſſively from them brought down to us by Church-Profeſſion. Wherefore the Apoſtles being Commiſſionated by him to whom was given all Power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, to this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, deliver'd to the World wholly and entirely the Law of Jeſus Chriſt; making ſo long ſtay in thoſe places prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in which by mutual conſent they had choſen to plant the Goſpel, 'till by often inculcation it was written in their hearts, and by practice ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd and clear'd to their Judgments, that rationally they could not miſtake or doubt concerning any points ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd; all things being by this means ſufficiently provided for the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and governing of the Church. Now though the Apoſtles were many, yet being all taught by the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, impowered by the ſame Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and guided by the ſame Spirit, in all parts of the World did bring up their Diſciples in the belief and practice of

Neither could it be otherwiſe, they only believing what was taught them by the Apoſtles: and theſe only teaching them what they receiv'd from Chriſt, and were Infallibly directed in by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which Apoſtolical Doctrines, one main Article was, <hi>That there ſhould be in all Ages to the Worlds end, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Viſible Body of Paſtors and People, term'd a</hi> Catholick <hi>Church, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely aſſiſted and authoriz'd to preſerve, teach and hand down to Posterity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Error, all Truths neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Catholick</hi> Church thus founded, practis'd and taught their Children what they received from the Apoſtles; condemning by her Authorative Rule of Tradition all ſuch for Hereticks and Shiſmaticks who taught any contrary Doctrines, and divided from them.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:200329:17"/> By this eaſie method all Critical Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about points of Faith were cut off, having only to inquire what had been taught and practis'd from the beginning, and to receive all Doctrines witneſſed for ſuch by the voice of the<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> preſent Church, <hi>The Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> and conſequently Infallible in her Atteſtation. Who leave this Rule, muſt needs be obnoxious to Error; but how thoſe who ſtick cloſe to ſo ſafe a Principle ſhould fail, is morally inconceivable. For ſuch Traditionary Doctrines (abſtracting from Authority) cannot looſe, but gather ſtrength by time, becauſe the multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers increafing, and delivering to their Children all points of Faith as they received them, the Tradition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more famous and univerſal, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying along with it a greater evidence of Truth, and moral Impoſſibility to be deceiv'd. Unleſs we will ſay that the Myſtical Body of Chriſt ſo diffus'd and numerous, can forget to day what they believ'd and acted yeſterday, and ſo ignorantly miſtake; or knowingly conſpire together to teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to receive any Doctrines as origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally proceeding from Chriſt and his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:200329:18"/> Apoſtles, which yet they never had from their immediate Fore-fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that tenure. Queſtionleſs that ſuch a Body of Chriſtians ſhould be wrought upon wilfully to damn their own and others Souls, by attempting to gull the World to their faces in a buſineſs of no leſs then Eternal Intereſt; or that in things of ſo high a nature, ſo viſible, ſo eaſily contradicted, they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to introduce the belief of a noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Lye, is ſurely to be rank'd in a high degree of Impoſſibility. And whoſoſever ſees it not as ſuch, I know not whether all the <hi>Hellibore</hi> in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra</hi> will cure him.</p>
                  <p>For where can one pick a hole in the everlaſting coat of univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make a way for Error or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy to creep in at? Does it not ſhine bright in the viſible Practice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Church ſcatter'd over the whole World, ſo continually expos'd to all mens Eyes and Ears, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceiv'd, how Doctrines ſo deliver'd, ſhould be innovated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovery and oppoſition, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh unleſs with the ruin of Chriſtianity? If <hi>Protestants</hi> conſidered this aright,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:200329:18"/> they could not deny the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Bleſſed <hi>Eucharist</hi> by a real change of the Conſecrated Elements; ſubjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as Supreme Head of the Church under Chriſt; Invocation of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Sacred uſe of Images, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Reliques, private Confeſſion to a Prieſt, Indulgences, Extream Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Purgatory, Prayer for the Dead, to be Apoſtolical Doctrines; being handed Traditionally to us from Age to Age, by an Univerſal and more Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Practice than the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which yet they receive, as the Word of God, upon the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Neither could they demand of us a farther proof of what carryes along with it in its very face, an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Credibility beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Nor ask of us in what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Repoſitaries of the Church theſe Traditions of the Church are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; when they might in a manner as rationally demand whether it be day, when the <hi>Sun</hi> is in the <hi>Meridian</hi> of our <hi>Horizon.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtles, having among other neceſſary points of Chriſtian Faith, rooted this Doctrine in their Diſciples hearts. To believe only what was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them; and alſo guarded it with

Yet queſtion'd it is, and contradicted alſo by <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants;</hi> but doubtleſs they do not conſider as they ought.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Church being in the poſſeſſion of this Belief upon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of Univerſal Tradition, (unleſs they can demonſtrate ſuch a tenure actually to have fail'd in this particular) muſt needs acknowledge this point concerning the Rule of Faith to be Apoſtolical.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They do not conſider, that ſeing it cannot be deny'd, but Tradition was at firſt the uſual means of Planting and Conſerving the Law of Chriſt, the greater part of the World being converted before the Scriptures
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:200329:22"/> were written and receiv'd by the Church, ſo that when any falſe Teachers did ariſe, they of neceſſity had recourſe to Tradition, whether they had been ſo Taught; and not to Scripture, whether it was ſo written, being impoſſible to Rule before it had a Beeing: I ſay, this being undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably evident, they will never be able to give a rational account to Intelligent perſons, why an immutable Faith ſhould have a mutable Rule, and a ſtanding Edifice ſhould have a moving Foundation. If they think to ſalve this ſoar, by ſaying Tradition was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary 'till the written word took place, they will never be able to prove that all things at firſt delivered neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Salvation of the World, were afterwards committed to writing by the Apoſtles. And yet 'till this be done ſatisfactorily, who ſees not the inſufficiency of this aſſertion?</p>
                  <p>But then Thirdly, if they could prove, that the whole Law of Chriſt neceſſary to Salvation, at firſt Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionarily convey'd, was afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely committed to writting by Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Inſpiration, and depoſited in the Church; They do not conſider, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:200329:22"/> were it ſo, (as moſt certainly they will be never able to prove) yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, Tradition ſhould be the Rule of Faith, as well after as before the reception of ſuch a Canon, it being impoſſible for Scripture by its ſelf to perform, what Tradition did without it in the beginning. For dead words being capable of endleſs controverſy, becauſe lyable to various Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Hereticks will either ſhrowd themſelves under the Umbrage of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Paſſages in Sacred Writ, or darken plain places with Metaphors or Clouds of witty Criticiſms, ſo that no evident Conviction can be had, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to hold up Church-unity in Faith and Government; except the controverted Doctrines be brought for their tryal to the Touch-ſtone of Oral Tradition, which, with the ſame uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring voice delivers Scripture and the true ſenſe of it to the Houſhold of Faith in all Ages.

                  <p>Laſtly, they do not conſider, that as in Natural Sciences there are ſome <hi>Prima Principia,</hi> fundamental Axioms, which need no proof, into which all Concluſions rightly from them dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced are reducible: So in ſupernatural Revelations there muſt be ſome ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Principle a Rule of Faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, points of Faith are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable having it ſelf no need of further probation as to ſuch evidence. Or elſe we run in a circle, not having any ſatisfactory ground, upon which we may without any more ado, rely for the Truth of what we believe. Now Scripture is not, nor can be ſuch a Principle; it depending manifeſtly, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves acknowledge, on Tradition, by which we only come certainly to know and accept it for the Word of God; and ſo is the Rule of Scripture as well as of other neceſſary points, and conſequently the ground or evidence of what we believe upon Scripture-Authority. Which yet is not to be underſtood, as if Tradition made the Word of God Infallible, but that thereby we are rationally aſſured what is Scripture, and the true ſenſe of it; which otherwiſe is ſubject to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:200329:23"/> perpetual quarrells, of Diſſenting minds.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I ſee not how <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> can anſwer this Argument; for they acknowledging Tradition to be the Rule of Scripture, and contending for Scripture to be the Rule of Faith, Tradition muſt neceſſarily be the prime Rule, that is, the Rule of their Rule, and antecedent ground of their foundation. And ſo by unavoidable conſequence, all their Faith is built upon the credit of Tradition. See it clear by a parallel. We <hi>Catholicks</hi> rely upon the Church for points of Faith; will <hi>Proteſtants</hi> therefore ſay that we rely not upon Tradition? For in relying upon the Church, we rely alſo upon what the Church relyes, which in all points of Faith is Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We rely upon the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately as an Infallible Guide, we rely upon Tradition as an extern Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. 'Tis eaſily applicable to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> receiving the Scriptures upon the credit of Tradition. Who, while they ſhun it as a ſtone of Offence, fall upon it as a Rock of Foundation. And truly 'till they ſhow us ſome other ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Principle, which can aſſure us
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:200329:24"/> what Doctrines Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught the World, we muſt believe and maintain Univerſal Tradition to be the Fundamental Rule of Faith to the Chriſtian Church in the ſenſe hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to explain'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus they might be ſatisfied with reaſon in this controverſy; but becauſe they pretend to be mov'd more with the Authority of the Fathers, than our Arguments, they ſhall hear them ſpeak; and truly, (one would think,) plain enough, to their condemnation.</p>

                     <hi>What if the Apoſtles had not left us Scriptures, ought we not to have followed the Rule of Tradition, which they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to thoſe to whom they committed the Churches.</hi> Which is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if becauſe they have left Scriptures, the order of Tradition is by them evacuated; but that revealed Truths depending on Tradition only, are as Divine and certain, as if no Scriptures had been left unto the Church by the Apoſtles. Or elſe we make the Saint; while he is ſhowing the excellent uſe and neceſſity of Church-Tradition, ſo Incongruous as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:200329:24"/> to ſay there is no need of it at all. But Arguments might be ſpar'd, when the following inſtance of Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving by Tradition only, without Scripture, makes his meaning evident.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:200329:30"/> degree of <hi>Tradition</hi> than the Books of Scripture; which were not any part of their Commiſſion, or by any joynt conſent intended to comprize the whole Law of Chriſt; but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an occaſional work of their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, according as the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances did require, writt by ſome ſingle Apoſtle or Evangeliſt, ſent to ſome particular Church or Perſon, (as all the Apoſtolical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles) upon whoſe Authority and Credit the whole Church originally muſt rely, to believe it to be the true Writing of ſuch an Evangeliſt or Apoſtle, that is, to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Word of God.</p>
                  <p>And this is the genuine reaſon, that while Traditionary Doctrines being on all hands acknowledg'd, becauſe founded in Univerſals which cannot eaſily fail: The true Books of Scripture, becauſe at firſt of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and unknown Authority, (agreeing therein with all errorus) were cauceouſly rejected by ſome particular Churches, and could not obtain due veneration and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:200329:31"/> but by degrees, as they were communicated to other Chriſtians by thoſe to whom they were at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and ſo at laſt upon diligent inquiſition received by the whole body of Believers for Canonical. In which examination, the <hi>Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Doctrine being univerſally Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and firſt planted in their hearts, and that of Scripture originally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and of an after Birth; They neither did, nor could rationally argue thus: The Doctrine we have been taught, is the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, becauſe agreeable to this Book: But thus, this Book atteſted to us for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may ſafely be received for the Writing of ſuch an Apoſtle or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical man, as they witneſs who have already accepted it for ſuch, becauſe we have no reaſon to think they are herein deceived, or lye againſt their Conſcience, in that we find it conformable to the Doctrine we have been taught and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Tradition. For to have proceeded <hi>è converſo,</hi> had been to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:200329:31"/> prove, I ſay not <hi>obſcurum per obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> but <hi>clarum per obſcurum,</hi> and contrary to all Rules of Logick and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that we find the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers expounding ſome Texts of Scripture for Traditionary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Church, which afford ſometimes perhaps ſcarce probable Topicks for thoſe points to which they are applyed. Now this they do, not as if they founded their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ſuch Articles upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:200329:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> points may be involved in thoſe Texts. So that we may ſafely argue thus far from ſuch expoſitions; they held ſuch Tenets, or elſe they would not have applyed thoſe places for the confirmation of ſuch Doctrines, though ſuch Doctrines cannot mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly be concluded from thoſe places. And therefore when <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> rationally ſhow, that ſome Texts ſo applyed by the Fathers may admit their Interpretations; yea ſometimes perhaps with greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, they muſt not think they then carry the cauſe againſt Them and Us in thoſe points.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:200329:32"/> that the Fathers neither did, nor doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rely upon ſuch Texts for thoſe particular points; nor yet upon Scripture for any point of Faith at all, but as handed and fenſed to us by <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to conclude this point, ſeing Scripture thus manifeſtly deſcends to us by a lower degree of <hi>Tradition</hi> than Chriſtian Doctrine; and being received for the Word of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of <hi>Tradition</hi> by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> themſelves; we cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wonder at their unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prevarication, in taking the Churches word for the whole Rule of their Belief, and yet refuſing to rely upon her credit for any one Article of Faith; in acknowledging her Authority Infallible in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Letter, and yet denying to believe her <hi>Tradition</hi> for the Sſenſe; nor will be perſwaded to conform to her in thoſe points and practices which are handed to us by her atteſtation with far greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of credibility.

How can ſuch as theſe eſcape the puniſhment threatned in the above-mentioned Sentences. Their account muſt needs be heavy; and the light they had will only ſerve to augment their guilt.</p>
                  <p>And I cannot omit for a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe and ſuch like Texts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that being ſo expreſs and unavoidable for the Churches Authority and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to her; in their firſt Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles after their

'Till afterwards, when by divers Artifices theſe Teachers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they had bred in their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers a ſtrong averſion from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they were ſufficiently confirmed in their Errours, the word <hi>Congregation</hi> in the later Tranſlation was turn'd into <hi>Church,</hi> that from the evidence of ſuch Texts they might gain ſome credit to their uſurp'd power, ſet up againſt the pre-exiſtent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it without reaſon, that Chriſt hath ſet up in his Church ſuch a ſupreme Judicature; when to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this Power to thoſe whom he hath appointed for ever to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Kingdom on Earth, is doubtleſs to advance the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue, above the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:200329:39"/> Church, their <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or <hi>Great Council,</hi> whesein the High-Prieſt was ſupreme Judge in all doubts<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> and queſtions about the Law, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch abſolute Authority in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sentence, that no man could appeal, but was bound to obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of death. And yet that was but a temporary Pedagogy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Moſes</hi> a faithful Servant of the Houſe of God, in Types and Shadows prefiguring and leading to Evangelical Perfection, whoſe Miniſtration is far more glorious, endowed with more tranſcendent and admirable Priviledges, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, and in pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of time fulfill'd, revealed and eſtabliſhed in Perſon by the Eternal Son of God, Lord of all things, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better Promiſes to continue for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt our Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo dearly purchas'd a peculiar People, and furniſh'd his Church with all means neceſſary to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mankind; if we deny ſuch Authority in her, namely Infallibility
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:200329:39"/> to witneſs, and when circumſtances require, to determine by a finally deciſive unerring Sentence what theſe means are, they cannot be effectual to the end for which they were with ſo much Sweat and Blood Inſtituted to continue for ever; being otherwiſe, according to the ordinary method of Divine Providence, impoſſible to be known with an aſſured certainty, and by conſequence alſo to be put in practice. Neither indeed could it be truly ſaid that Chriſt hath provided in his Church all things neceſſary for our Salvation without this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; when amongſt things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that queſtionleſs ſeems to be moſt ſo, by which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we can only come to a certain knowledge of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſeeing God hath made his Church a Proponent and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Truth in all Ages, (for<note place="margin">1 ch. 8.</note> that of the <hi>Acts, Ye ſhall be witneſſes to me, both in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and all</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea, <hi>and in</hi> Samaria, <hi>and unto the uttermoſt parts of the Earth:</hi> As to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:200329:40"/> the ſubſtance of it; belongs not only to the Apoſtles, but to their Succeſſors in the Office of making Jeſus Chriſt and his Law known to the Worlds end,) the unanimous conſent of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church muſt needs be an undoubted teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of revealed Verities, ſeeing it contradicts the Juſtice, Goodneſs, and Veracity of God to authorize any to be a witneſs of his Truth, that might lye and deceive the World in their atteſtation. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it concerns as well <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> as Us, to maintain the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church for an Infallible Witneſs, ſeeing at this diſtance from the Preaching of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; they, as well as we, have no other Infallible aſſurance then her Teſtimony whereby to know ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are the undoubtd Books of Scripture, or what the true meaning of them. And thus that Religion (which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> pretend to be contain'd in only Scripture, muſt rejecting Church Authority neceſſarily float in an

                  <p>Laſtly, the fore-quoted Texts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo expreſs for the Church to have a Power from Chriſt to oblige all men under pain of Damnation to believe and ſubmit to her Propoſals as to Faith. God hath alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed her with Infallibility in bringing to our knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Verities, ſeeing otherwiſe ſuch a Power in the Church, and a correſpondent obligation in her Children would not bear an equal proportion. And therefore theſe two are inſeparably link'd together, a Power to bind to Believe, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in the Obliger; Chriſt aſſiſting his Church with his Holy Spirit to guide her Infallibly into all Truth, becauſe he hath inveſted her with a Power to bind to believe; and giving her a Power of obliging to believe, becauſe he hath made
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:200329:41"/> her Infallible in ſuch Propoſals. It ſeeming moſt conformable to the Divine Goodneſs and Providence, that ſuch an externe proponant of Faith ſhould be eſtabliſhed, as might afford no juſt cauſe to ſuſpect whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or no, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; and in all reaſon no greater aſſurance can be deſired then to have an abſolute certainty that that Authority cannot err in points of Faith, to whom we muſt in ſuch Propoſals captivate our Wills and Underſtandings. For this is but to aſſent upon undoubted evidence; then which nothing is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to mans nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither is it rational to believe that God, who is eſſential, Reaſon and Wiſdom, ruling all his Creatures according to the ſeveral Diſpoſitions Imprinted in them, would impoſe ſuch a Duty on Diſcourſive Entities upon other terms.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be God who hath ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided for us, in giving us a Law which is the only means to Salvation, and alſo an authorized
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:200329:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> guide to direct us in the certain knowledge of it; namely the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> which cannot poſſibly lead us into errour, as hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>Thus certainly theſe Scriptures witneſſing the Churches Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are agreeable to reaſon; now let us ſee what further light can be added to them from the Writings and univerſal practice of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, That though the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are Infallible and cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, yet if we will not deceive our ſelves and kill our Souls by the dead Letter without the quickning ſenſe, we muſt believe what the Church believes, ſubmitting our private reaſon to her publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.

                  </p>

                  <p>And the prime end for which Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils were inſtituted and endowed with this ſupreme Judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power, being for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith, by the Authoritative condemnation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Hereſies, the next Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Synod celebrated at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> againſt <hi>Macedonius</hi> and<note place="margin">Ann.

                  <p>Yet not as making new Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Creeds, or preciſe Articles of Faith not before in beeing, (for that would require new Revelations of God's Will, which <hi>Catholicks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to, acknowledging Chriſt to be a perfect Law-giver by himſelf and his Apoſtles) but only declaring and explicating what already is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed when call'd in queſtion.

                  <p>For <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith always is the ſame, although the Evidence and verbal Notions of that Faith are not always alike; nor is it material, ſo they be but ſound and agreeable to <hi>Tradition;</hi> yea, ſometimes words never before in Eccleſiaſtical uſe, are accepted by General Councils into the Churches language to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her immutable Faith, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances then require, for the more efficacious redreſs of preſent evils; and preventing all miſtakes of that nature for the future, even in the earneſt underſtandings.

Neither will the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be ever able to give any ſatisfactory reaſon why they do not give the ſame veneration and acceptance to all approv'd <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Synods,</hi> and in particular to that of <hi>Trent,</hi> being confirmed by the ſame viſible Head, and received by the Body of the ſame <hi>Catholick</hi> Church.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:200329:56"/>
                  <p>And to make this more evident; I will make a brief parallel of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Caſe with the <hi>Arians,</hi> (by them confeſs'd to be <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>) by which I think will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcover'd that they can ſay nothing to juſtify themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Council, but will be as good and ſtrong for the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> againſt the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers; their tryals being alike upon their diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Peace of the Church with new Doctrines, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation alike by the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. If they ſay the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was not a lawful General Council; did not the <hi>Arians</hi> pretend the ſame againſt the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, and all <hi>Hereticks</hi> take up the ſame Plea againſt the Councils by whom they were condemned? If they ſay, true, they did ſo; but They without cauſe, We juſtly. Let them give us a demonſtration of this, and we are ſatisfied; and nothing elſe can carry it in this controverſy.</p>
                  <p>Did not the <hi>Arians</hi> repute the <hi>Novatians Hereticks,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:200329:56"/> by a Council, though not General? And yet refus'd themſelves to ſtand to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod though <hi>Oecumenical.</hi> Why? The <hi>Novatians,</hi> ſay the <hi>Arians, complain without cauſe; We juſtly.</hi> Did not the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians</hi> abhor the the <hi>Arians</hi> as juſtly anathematiz'd by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and yet theſe refuſe to obey the Decrees of the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Council, thoſe of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan?</hi> Why? The <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> contradicted without cauſe, ſay the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> but we juſtly. In a word, 'tis a plea common to all condemned <hi>Hereticks,</hi> with <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and if they would ſpeak fully, amounts to thus much: <hi>We will receive no Councils farther then they agree with us, and will never acknowledge or ſubmit to any as lawful that condemn our Doctine.</hi> For when they they have a long time hunted up and down for excuſes, this in reality is the only and juſteſt cauſe they have of their diſobedience.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:200329:57"/>
                  <p>If they appeal from the Council to the Scriptures, as in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtanding for them; did not the <hi>Arians</hi> do the ſame? And I dare be bold to ſay with far more probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then <hi>Proteſtants</hi> can pretend to in many points controverted between Them and Us. If they ſay they never had a fair hearing before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was paſs'd againſt them, and that they were condemn'd by their Enemies, being Judges in their own cauſe. Did not, or might not the <hi>Arians,</hi> and any other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> pretend the ſame againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Councils by which they were condemned? And 'tis all one, as if ſome Rebels ſtubbornly refuſing to anſwer for themſelves in a juſt Tryal according to the eſtabliſh'd Laws of the Kingdom which they have tranſgreſſed, ſhould after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounc'd complain of Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal proceedings as not being heard for themſelves, and having no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to plead, where the Party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was their Judge by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</p>

However, that I might give the Religion I had profeſs'd ſo long a full hearing to the beſt of my abilities and underſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhak'd hands with it, I dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examin'd the grounds of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church and Doctrine, (which too few do,) and after much enquiry, it was evident to me, they could not afford to Impartial Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments any ſolid and real ſatisfaction. For the main Pillar of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, being to make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the ſole Rule of Faith, I finding by clear conviction this foundation to be without Solidity, how could I in Reaſon or Conſcience ſtand firm to that Church which I ſaw built on ſo unſtable a bottom.

               <p>Firſt, ſhe teaches, <hi>That Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth (explicitly) contain all things neceſſary to Salvation, ſo that whatſoever is not read therein is not to be required of any man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation.</hi> This the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of her Articles do teach, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:200329:65"/> this they muſt teach who will make the written Word an entire Rule of Faith; that is, comprehending all points neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now in all reaſon to ſatisfy thoſe whom they would perſwade to be of this belief, it ought to be made evident, that the Apoſtles in their Writings did intend plainly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to comprize whatſoever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believ'd and practis'd by all Chriſtians, and depoſited them in the Church as a complete Rule of Faith for the tryal of all Doctrines, ſhe alſo receiving it for ſuch, and practiſing accordingly in all Ages. Which once done, their poſition is then a moſt clear and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional inference. But this being impoſſible for them to prove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe contradicted by the Faith and practice of the Primitive Church, which could not be ignorant of all Apoſtolical Doctrines and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo of preſent <hi>Catholicks</hi> receiving them from her by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted viſible Tradition, muſt needs be a falſe and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:200329:65"/> Principle, though laid for the foundation of their Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for a further ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work ſhe teaches, <hi>That General Councils may, and have erred, even in things appertaining to God.</hi> That is, in matters of Faith, as well as of Fact, as her own Expoſitions more freely expreſs her meaning. A Doctrine, the firſt Reformers would never have given place in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Spiritural building, even for their own ſakes, but that it was not poſſible their new Fabrick of Faith could ſtand for any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time without fall of the Churches Authority. Were not they then ſit men to be credited, if General Councils may err?</p>
               <p>But that which follows, <hi>Wherefore things ordained by them as neceſſary unto Salvation have neither ſtrength nor Authority, unleſs it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they be taken (explicitely) out of Holy Scriptures,</hi> Is the very quinteſſence of <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> ſo deſtructive of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (though an Engine made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Now let it be conſidered that Church Governours are inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Keys of ſo wonderful and tranſcendent power committed to their hands. <hi>That whatſoever they</hi>

               <p>Which things whoſoever layes together, and ſeriouſly ponders, as I did, cannot but diſcover that the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant</hi> Reformers did not receive a Rule of Faith from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, which had been the Square of Chriſtian belief in all Ages, and is to continue ſo for ever, but invented (or rather aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed from their Predeceſſors the Ancient <hi>Hereticks</hi>) a Rule of Faith for the Church they were ſetting up, whereby they thought their new Doctrines might with moſt likelihood be maintain'd, and found no better expedient then by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an authoriz'd Viſible Judge to pronounce a definitive Sentence in

Now they having denyed the Church this right, and ſo caſt off her living voice and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in plain terms, though inſiſting in generals, they aſſign no other determinate Interpreter, yet muſt have recourſe to Reaſon, or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for beſides theſe three I know not any. I ſay, they muſt either let private Reaſon make this declaration, and Judge of the true
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:200329:71"/> ſenſe of Scripture, by her innate Light; or flie to Revelation, and Pretend that the Holy Ghoſt Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly declares by a Divine Light his meaning to them.</p>
               <p>This later way of Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid claim to by the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical</hi> party, and thoſe ſtrange broods of other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sectaries. who have nothing but Scripture and the Spirit of God in their mouths, upon whom in a moſt Prodigious manner they Father all their Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to the ſhame of Chriſtians. But it is rejected by all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in any degree rational as meerly <hi>Fanatical,</hi> and invincibly convicted of Impoſture by the manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions of ſeveral pretenders to the Spirit of God.

               <p>Private reaſon therefore is only left them to reſolve their Faith into,

               <p>If they ſay this Objection is not pertinent, becauſe whoſoever makes the written word of God the ſole and ſufficient Rule of Faith, muſt neceſſarily pre-ſuppoſe the belief of Scripture founded upon ſome other Principle.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:200329:74"/> to Salvation; handing them down from the Apoſtles themſelves to us now living, as the revealed Truths of Jeſus Chriſt, and believed as ſuch by all reſpective Ages upon that tenure.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:200329:77"/> yet they will needs have the Holy Scriptures to be the only and perfect Rule of Faith. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it had been more ſafe and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous to have acknowledg'd with the Ancient Fathers <hi>Traditionary</hi> Doctrines, as well as the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to compleat the Rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian belief; but contradicting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity by contracting the Rule of Faith into Scripture alone, they have likewiſe contradicted themſelves, the inevitable Fate of all Truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppoſers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Holy Scriptures are not clearly evident without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute in all points neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them; and conſequently no compleat nor certain Rule of themſelves, as the common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Ages makes good.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:200329:77"/> Then certainly the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who had as ſubtil Heads and able Brains as any <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to underſtand the <hi>Logick</hi> of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, were mad men to appeal from <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> to the written Word.

Yea, they doubted not but there were Texts for them more evidently aſſerting the Inferiority of the Son, and appropriating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature to the Father only; which was the ground of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in appealing to the written Word, to be tryed thereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Tradition.</hi> And yet the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> condemn the <hi>Arians</hi> for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and juſtly too; But how they can do it rationally upon their own Principles, I confeſs ſurpaſſes

               <p>Again, it is no doubt but a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons in the Unity of the Godhead, is ſubſtantially or materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contain'd in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in formal expreſs terms Trinity, and Perſonality or Perſon, are not to be found; nor yet ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in any Texts, as from them ſatisfactorily to convince the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarians</hi> that the ſame indiviſible Eſſence, is equally and perfectly in three diſtinct Perſons, unleſs we call in Church-Authority and <hi>Tradition</hi> conſtantly ſo explicating thoſe places to our aſſiſtance. For 'tis well known by expert Controvertiſts, that ſuch Texts are confronted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which ſeem to contradict them;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:200329:78"/> with an appearance plauſible enough to vulgar underſtandings; yea, and which are ſometimes ſo perplex'd and intricate as to vex the moſt Learned for a ſatisfactory Solution. And even might ſhake the Faith of many good Chriſtians, had they not <hi>

And this is a manifeſt and undenyable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that thoſe who forſake theſe Principles to ground themſelves on Scripture only for all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, have always made Shipwrack of Faith, and run into <hi>Hereſies.</hi> A thing as manifeſt in <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as in any <hi>Separatiſts</hi> from the Church in former Ages.

                  </note> direction of that people in all things relating to God and his Worſhip: Nevertheleſs when any difficulty or doubt aroſe, the written Word was not to decide the queſtion as a Judge, but the Sentence to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the High-prieſt; and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto required under pain of death: How comes it to paſs, that under the Law of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> not committed in that exact manner to writing, yet in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to God and his Worſhip, Scripture it ſelf ſhould be the only Judge of Controverſies, and thoſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:200329:81"/> to whom Chriſt hath committed the Government of his Church, ſhould not have one Authoritative word to ſay for their final deciſion? Is this rational? Alas, poor Chriſtian Church whoſe Glory is out-ſhin'd by legal ſhadows! For with them <hi>Sarah</hi> the Miſtreſs hath leſs power then her Hand-maid <hi>Agar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, when the contention is concerning the ſenſe of Scripture in any fundamental point deliver'd, but obſcurely, it is poſſible for the written Word to give a clear Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and determine the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy about it ſelf: For then it would be both obſcure and clear in the ſame matter, and in the ſelf ſame reſpect, at the ſame time, flat contradiction.</p>
               <p>If they ſay there's no fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal point but is evidently contain'd in Sacred Writ, the contrary hath been manifeſted in the precedent <hi>Section.</hi> And for further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I here ask, whether, <hi>Hoc eſt Copus meum, Hic eſt Sanguis meus;</hi> be not plain words without any

Can ſuch variety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety proceed but from obſcurity? Either from that, or elſe ſome of them muſt wilfully contradict Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt by maintaining a dangerous Doctrine againſt their own knowledge and Conſcience.

               <p>We find in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the Chariot of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and hearing him read<note place="margin">Act 8. 30, 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And he ſaid, how can I except ſome man guide me?</hi> He had not learn'd the Principle of their <hi>Rationaliſts</hi> to bid the Holy man ſpare his pains of Expoſition; or if he would be doing, that he was not bound to believe one word he ſpoke for Truth 'till his own reaſon made it Authentick. For this wild Doctrine frees every man in matters of Eternity from all Authority of humane Teachers though of Divine Inſtitution; ſo that be we <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> or in what Church ſoever we have been Baptiz'd, we muſt ſtand to no <hi>Creed,</hi> believe no <hi>Catechiſm</hi> or abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of points neceſſary, though confirm'd by the practice of the whole <hi>Christian</hi> World, rely on no <hi>Inſtructors,</hi> but believe and practice the quite contrary, if our private reaſon judges it to be contain'd in Sacred Scripture. Doubtleſs if his judgment had been prepoſeſs'd with this proud, arrogant Principle, <hi>Philip</hi> had preach'd in vain, nor had he believ'd unto Salvation, but

               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:200329:87"/>
               <p>Laſtly, I deſire them to reconcile this Article of our Ancient <hi>Creed, I believe the Holy Catholick Church,</hi> with their novel Doctrine, <hi>The Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church hath nothing to do with my Faith, I believe my own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and nothing elſe; in giving the true ſenſe of Scripture to me.</hi> For my part, it being clear to me from the written Word, that the Church hath a promiſe of Infallibility in matters of Faith, That there is a command from Chriſt laid upon every one to hear her voice under pain of damnation, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the above named Article would not have been inſerted into the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> as a fundamental point, I could ſee no ſafety or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in matters of eternal Intereſt, but by wholly renouncing my moſt weak, deceitful ſelf, and delivering up my ſelf entirely into the hands of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, to be taught by her what I muſt Believe and Do to be ſaved: Nor found I any thing more reaſonable then to captivate my underſtanding to the obedience
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:200329:87"/> of Faith, when the God of reaſon doth require it at our hands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to make every one an Interpreter and Judge of the true ſenſe of Holy Scripture for himſelf unappealably by Reaſon, ſeems e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently to me to deprive us of the only rational and ſolid means which is required to produce a well grounded Faith of Supernatural Verities in the Soul of man. Which thus I manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Supernatural Faith being an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the underſtanding to things revealed, meerly for the Authority of the Relator, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpute when once we have an aſſurance that God hath revealed them; two things muſt neceſſarily concurre in all mediate productions to beget this act firmly and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in any Soul; namely, <hi>Iſt.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation of things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, which is the formal Object of Faith, into which it is ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolv'd; And <hi>2dly.</hi> A certain knowledge or moral evidence that ſuch are revealed, by the mediation
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:200329:88"/> or intervention of which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding elevated by Grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the foreſaid aſſent. Now ſuppoſe there were no Objects of Supernatural and Divine Faith but what are contain'd in the written Word, 'tis not the bare and naked Letter, but Scripture rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that is the Word of God and of Infallible verity; except therefore we have ſome <hi>Medium,</hi> or means to convey aſſuredly to our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true ſenſe of Scripture, our Faith cannot but halt and totter, when we cannot rationally afford a firm aſſent to ſuch a thing as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect whither we rightly underſtand that Scripture which contains the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And certainly this cauſe of ſuſpition will be ever juſt while pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reaſon is the Interpreter and Judge of Holy Writ, when abundant experience tells us nothing is more Fallible, nothing more deceitful, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſooner bribed with pride, or paſſion, or prejudice, or education, or intereſt; to make words ſpeak what
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:200329:88"/> never the Author intended by them. Inſomuch that hardly any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point delivered in Scripture, but hath been called in queſtion, and ſtill is by too many, proteſting withall their ſincerity and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to attain to the true ſenſe of Scripture by the light of their own Reaſon, to which they appeal as their Judge and Protector in thoſe wilful and irrational proceedings. Neither indeed have <hi>Hereſies</hi> aroſe in the Church but from Scripture miſinterpreted by private reaſon, as the <note n="*" place="margin">Non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde natae ſunt haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, niſi quod Scripturae bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur non benè St. <hi>Aug.</hi> Tract 18 in <hi>Jeab.</hi> Er de Gen. ad Lit. l. 7 ca. 9.

               <p>The <hi>Catholick</hi> Church indeed is inriched with ſo great a priviledge by Chriſt our Saviour, that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err in things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (as hath been manifeſted in the precedent <hi>Motive</hi> by <hi>Reaſon, Fathers, Councils, Scripture, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and practice of the <hi>Christian</hi> World.) Whom we may as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly believe in delivering to us the true ſenſe of Scripture as the Letter; and upon whom relying we have only a firm and rational belief of revealed Verities, conſtant and immoveable among all the changes of <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, in every act of Faith there is uſe of Reaſon, whether it be referred to the Authority of God revealing, or the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing. For we captivate our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the obedience of Faith, becauſe we judge nothing more reaſonable than to believe God; and we ſecurely rely upon his Church whom he hath promis'd to aſſiſt with Infallibility in ſuch propoſals. But ſhall we ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:200329:89"/> that Reaſon is the prime intrinſical Motive of Faith, and into which it finally is reſolv'd; Nothing leſs. For this diſcourſe and approbation of Reaſon are but neceſſarily previous and antecedent to our deliberate and rational acts of Faith; the acts themſelves are acts of the underſtanding not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, but purely aſſenting. Which aſſent is not for Reaſons ſake, but for Authority. Were the laſt reſolution into the judgment of private Reaſon, Faith could not be Divine or Supernatural. Reaſon indeed produces an act of Faith as well in <hi>Catholicks</hi> as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but with a vaſt difference. For a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> believes ſuch a Truth to be from God, relying upon his Reaſon only that it is revealed; and this aſſent is not rational, becauſe his ground is deceitful. But in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Reaſon acts only ſo far in points of belief as to bring him to Authority, declaring ſuch Truths to be ſufficiently revealed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, which he cannot with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:200329:90"/> any reaſon ſuſpect to be Fallible in ſuch declarations. <hi>I believe this,</hi> ſays a <hi>Proteſtant, becauſe my Reaſon tells me it is revealed, and will allow no other judge of this Revelation. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this,</hi> ſays a <hi>Catholick, becauſe an Infallible Authority aſſures me i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is revealed; and my Reaſon tells me there is no other ſufficient ground or evidence for Divine Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give up my private judgment to the Church.</hi> And which of theſe Principles is more ſafe and rational let Reaſon judge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I demand of theſe <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts,</hi> whether there be any ſuch thing as <hi>Hereſy</hi> in the World, and what it is? <hi>Oportet eſse Haereſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> &amp;c. <hi>There muſt be Hereſies;</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid it, and that's ſufficient. And as for what it is, 'tis well known the Church hath always, taught, <hi>That</hi> Hereſie <hi>is the voluntary Election of ſome private opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the Doctrine of the Church. And that he is to be accounted an</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick <hi>who neglecting the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with a ſtubborn mind defends
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:200329:90"/> wicked opinions.</hi> But if we ſhould admit their new definition, <hi>That</hi> Hereſie <hi>is to contradict any fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal point expreſly contain'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> In my poor judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch a definition, there's no ſuch thing as <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks;</hi> but both <hi>Arians, Anabaptiſts, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,</hi> &amp;c. are as good <hi>Catholicks</hi> as any Chriſtians of the World. For if private Reaſon be the only judge of the true Senſe of Scripture for every one to rely upon, theſe, and all other condemned <hi>Hereticks</hi> (the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> excepted) relying upon the written Word, as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by Reaſon, with ſober en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and real endeavours to find out Truth, cannot juſtly be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. The <hi>Arians</hi> have ſo much Reaſon and Scripture too in the bare Letter on their ſide, that take away the Churches Infallibility and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>Tradition</hi> interpreting and delivering to us the true ſenſe of it, the Controverſy would never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. All places would ſwarm with <hi>Neſtorians, Eutychians, Anti-trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:200329:91"/> Barengarians, Anabaptists,</hi> &amp;c. neither could we condemn them, if this Principle be good, for doing their duty in following Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the Light of their own private Reaſon or Spirit dictates to them.</p>
               <p>Let them not ſay, that theſe, and ſuch like are juſtly condemn'd for contradicting expreſs Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their knowledge, and the judgment of their own Reaſon. For they muſt remember; firſt, that themſelves do not condemn the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> upon only Scripture grounds, Secondly, that it hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that all fundamental points are not ſo expreſs in Scripture as they imagine. And thirdly, that 'tis moſt uncharitable to ſay, <hi>That all thoſe whom they condemn for</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks <hi>do againſt their own knowledge and Conſcience contradict the expreſs Word of God, and run headlong to hell with their eyes open.</hi> Can we poſſibly imagine, that among ſo many Millions of <hi>Arians</hi> there was not one ſingle perſon had any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:200329:91"/> It cannot be denyed but that many <hi>Hereticks</hi> have, and do live Vertuouſly in the Eyes of the World: For who knows not, <hi>That Satan ſometimes transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light?</hi> And while they profeſs, and proteſt, that if it was once made apparent to them that their Tenets are againſt the Word of God, they would not one minute perſiſt in them; we judge it uncharitable to affirm, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the proteſtations of their ſincerity and real (though miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided) zeal, they all wilfully ſin againſt the Light and knowledge of their Conſciences. We <hi>Catholicks</hi> indeed aſſert, <hi>That ſufficient eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of credibility are produced by us to convince them of their Heretical opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and dangerous ſtate without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> But withall we ſay, <hi>That God in his juſt Judgments, which are inſcrutable, ſuffers them through ſtrong deluſions to believe Lyes, in that the Light of Truth is veiled from their Eyes by paſſion, or prejudice, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt, while they ſo continue;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:200329:92"/> and we pray for them, in hope that the Father of infinite Mercies will in his good time diſcover Truth unto them, and bring them home unto his Church.</hi> But for theſe <hi>Rationaliſts</hi> to damn all thoſe whom they eſteem <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as contradictors of the Word of God againſt their Conſcience and knowledge, is a cenſure moſt unreaſonable, and little beſeeming ſuch whoſe lives are not ſo Goſpel-like, but that many <hi>Sectaries</hi> who differ from them in fundamentals may juſtly be reputed at leaſt as conſcientious, and in charity cannot be thought otherwiſe. All which duely conſider'd, plainly proves, that they muſt either change their Judge of Controverſy in points of Faith, or give us ſome new Rule, to diſcover <hi>Hereſy.</hi> And withall, that if they will ſtick cloſe to this Principle, they muſt maintain that all the General Councils of the Church, even that celebrated by the Apoſtles themſelves, were meer ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Uſurpations, in obliging all Chriſtians to believe and practice
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:200329:92"/> according to their Decrees, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their private Reaſon could ſay to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in vain and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Overſeers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in his Church, <hi>For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi>

                  <hi>the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edification of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. If every one muſt acknowledge no viſible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon Earth, to have any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging power over him in Doctrines appertaining to God, but be his own Teacher in all points of Faith according to the Dictates of private Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If every one be ſent to Scripture to compoſe a <hi>Creed</hi> for himſelf, 'tis impoſſible there ſhould be any unity among the Chriſtians in Faith and Worſhip. That is, 'tis impoſſible there ſhould be any ſuch thing upon earth as one only <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church. Of the breach of which unity, endleſs diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who adhere to this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:200329:93"/> Principle are apparent and moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible demonſtrations.</p>
               <p>Laſtly whoſoever ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the difficulties of Languages, the multiplicity of the occaſions and intentions of the Writers, the various lections in Copies of the Original, the infinite and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable differences in Tranſlations, the equivocation and ambiguity of Words, the variety and obſcurity of Circumſtances, together with the weakneſs of all, and ignorance of moſt men, endeavouring by themſelves from dead Letters to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the knowledge of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime myſteries of our Holy Faith, tranſcending all humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and comprehenſion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude that 'tis altogether impoſſible, that private Reaſon ſhould be the only Interpreter and Judge of the true Senſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for every one to rely upon for his Salvation; ſeeing nothing can be certainly gather'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of naked words conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red barely in themſelves, involving
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:200329:93"/> ſo many difficulties and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in regard to incomparably the greater part of mankind. And if a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Preacher will ſpeak out ingeniouſly in this point, he muſt tell his Auditors in theſe, or ſuch like words: <hi>Beloved, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to ſearch the Scriptures; and whatſoever we ſay is neceſsary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to believe us only ſo far as your own Reaſon doth tell you we teach according to the Word of God; for that is the Rule, and private Reaſon the ſole Judge to give an unappealable Sentence in ſuch Caſes. This is our Doctrine, and this is alſo your practice; but truely Beloved, all things rightly conſidered, we muſt needs confeſs that 'tis an unſteady foundation, to build your Faith and Salvation upon; for after this way of proceeding, you are infinitely obnoxious to dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and cannot but deceive your ſelves in matters that concern your everlaſting Happineſs.</hi> So he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingenuouſly: Neither indeed can rational ſecurity be had in things of eternal Intereſt; 'till repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

The Prophet grieved at this Vengeance provoking ſin, ſends them to the Law and to the Teſtimony, where this grand impiety was forbidden; and withall puts them in mind of<note place="margin">Levit. 20. 6 27.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:200329:97"/> who ſeeing his moſt Holy Life and many Miracles to atteſt his Miſſion could not rationally think he would deceive them with a Lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now more they could not deſire, when the force of theſe invincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or nothing could dint and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify their rocky hearts to receive the impreſſion of ſaving Faith. However, our Bleſſed Saviour to give them all poſſible ſatisfaction, makes uſe of a fourth Topick from the Holy Scriptures,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>which he bids them ſearch,</hi> For in them, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which teſtify of me. <hi>Which Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras'd is thus much. If ye will not receive the three former Teſtimonies, which are moſt proper and efficacious to work Faith in your hearts, but ſhut your eyes againſt Light ſufficient to turn the darkneſs of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah <hi>into day; yet the Scriptures, which ye receive and acknowledge, bear ſuch witneſs of me, that if ye did ſearch into them with humble hearts, ye could not but be convinc'd of the Truth I preach unto you. In them indeed ye
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:200329:97"/> think ye have eternal Life, but while malice and pride thus blind your eyes, ye deceive your ſelves, and make them a killing Letter to your Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let who will apply it, the Argument runs thus, Our Bleſſed Saviour having made uſe of the moſt powerful means to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> of their Infidelity, and they yet perſiſting in their Blaſphemies, at laſt for their greater confuſion made uſe of an argument from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they received, <hi>Therefore Scripture is the ſole Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about Religion.</hi> How this follows I underſtand not, when our Bleſſed Saviour in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, ſends them not only to the written Word, but uſes it as the laſt, and perhaps leaſt evidence of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and Miſſion.</p>
               <p>It clearly makes indeed for us <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who as our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour brought St. <hi>Johns</hi> Teſtimony againſt his Advetſaries, ſo do we likewiſe againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Ancient Fathers, Martyrs and Confeſſors of all Ages to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:200329:98"/> for us in the preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies; as alſo the voice of God from Heaven by many Miracles ſpeaking in defence of the Truths which we profeſs. They in this like to obdurate <hi>Jews</hi> deſpiſe theſe unanſwerable evidences, which are Motives ſufficient to work on Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and will admit no Rule nor Judge but the Holy Scriptures to decide the quarrel. Thinking, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, to have Eternal Life in them, but with that incredulous people likewiſe deceive themſelves, do obſerve the Light of Divine Truth, by drawing as it were a vail of private and perverſe Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions over their Eyes, to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perdition.</p>
               <p>I add moreover, that had our Bleſſed Saviour only appealed to the Propheſies of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> concerning himſelf, as ſufficient to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> that he was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſo that nothing elſe was neceſſary or requiſite for the clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing of that point; yet I ſee not how this concluſion will follow,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:200329:98"/> therefore all neceſſary points of Faith are ſo fully and plainly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to writing in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> under the Law of Grace, that there's no other Rule nor Judge to know and determine how many, and what they are, when contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted among Chriſtians. Yet this muſt follow, or this Text doth them no good for the end they uſe it, as moſt certainly it does not.</p>
               <p>Which anſwer likewiſe takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſtrength from that place in the <hi>Asts</hi> of the Apoſtles, where the <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended for ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, whether thoſe things were ſo as St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught, and they believed before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the written Word, upon the Authority of their Teacher, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his Doctrine to be the Word of God by frequent Miracles. Upon inquiry indeed it could not but be much ſatisfaction to them to find ſo much of the Light of the Goſpels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the Shadows of the Law; and the Predictions of the Prophets to be ſo exactly fulfill'd in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:200329:99"/> of Chriſt; and about theſe it was that St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed out of Scripture, and for which they ſearch'd after their believing, and and ſo comes not home to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For that the whole Law of Chriſt or all <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrines ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation are plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and may ſatisfactorily be prov'd from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets I preſume our Adverſaries will not maintain, and ſo their Argument from hence is at an end.</p>
               <p>To that in the <hi>20th.</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> I anſwer, that the true ſenſe and meaning of thoſe words is this: That St. <hi>John</hi> teſtifies to the World he hath written a Book of the Life and Death of our Bleſſed Saviour, when the Miracles wrought by him, and therein deliver'd, did ſufficiently evidence him to be the Son of God and the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> according to his Doctrine, without belief in whoſe Name they could not be ſaved. And not that all neceſſary points of Faith were ſo deliver'd in this Goſpel, as to be intended by him for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:200329:99"/> Rule of Belief, and Judge of all Controverſies in Fundamentalls to the Chriſtian World. Neither can any rational man, except blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Paſſion, or bribed with Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but perceive this latter Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be forced, and the other natural. To believe in Chriſt as the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, is a fundamental of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, without which Salvation is not to be had; But to believe this only is not ſufficient, nor can be the ſcope of this Text; when 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many neceſſary points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian belief are not contain'd in this <hi>Evangelist.</hi> Who, as 'tis uſual with other Sacred Pen-men of Gods Word, aſcribes the vertue of that effect to ſome principal or ſpecial cauſes, though but partial, which proceeds alſo from other by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary concatenation or connexion, to make up the whole and adequate cauſe of ſuch a product: We are ſaid in Scripture <hi>to be ſaved by Hope;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24:</note> is it therefore of it ſelf ſufficient for Salvation? Is therefore Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded?

                  <hi>Faith,</hi> are not good works neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? What means then St. <hi>Paul</hi> to tell us, <hi>That though we have all Faith</hi>

                  <hi>calls on the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> Is it therefore enough of it ſelf to bring a man to Heaven? The Truth is, Prayer ſaves us, good Works ſave us, Faith ſaves us, Hope ſaves us; and therefore properly enough they are ſaid to do it ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, though only conjointly they are ſufficient: And when St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>He writ the Life and Death of Jeſus Chriſt, that thorough Faith in his Name we might be ſaved;</hi> He little dream'd that in after Ages a Generation of men would ariſe that ſhould affirm he taught; <hi>That his Goſpel did compriſe in particular all fundamental points of Faith ſufficient for the Salvation of mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that in <hi>Timothy</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, 'tis evident by the Gontext
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:200329:100"/> that the Holy Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> being ſuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> had learn'd from his Childhood, (when little, if any, of the <hi>New</hi> could be written and divulg'd) out of which I am confident our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will not pretend to determine all points of <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by themſelves neceſſary to Salvation; which quite overthrows their Argument from this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe we ſhould grant it to be underſtood of the Scriptures of the <hi>New Covenant;</hi> yet it will not follow from hence that therefore they are a compleat and perfect Rule of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge all Doctrines whether they be revealed verities, or not; when from the <hi>4th. Verſe</hi> 'tis clear to any underſtanding eye, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy to hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the Faith,</hi> received princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally upon the tenure of <hi>Tradition:</hi> Which is our <hi>Catholick</hi> Rule, and to which we muſt ſtick cloſe, as he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where teaches us, <hi>Though an Angel</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>from Heaven ſhould preach the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:200329:101"/> This <hi>Timothy</hi> was to do, this <hi>Traditionary Depoſitum</hi> he was to keep, whether ne had been ver'd or no in the <hi>Old Scriptures,</hi> or any <hi>New</hi> written and depoſited in the Church. Yet withall, he puts in mind of a peculiar advantage to confirm his Faith received by <hi>Oral Tradition, And make him a perfect man of God or Biſhop throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd unto all good works proper to his Paſtoral Office, in that from his Infancy he had been brought up in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make men wiſe unto Salvation through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and are profitable for Teaching, for Arguing, for Reproving, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing in Righteouſneſs the Flock committed to his Charge.</hi> And thus indeed it makes againſt themſelves, and for us highly, who makes uſe of Scripture for a Rule of Faith as regulated and expounded by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> But to force the words to ſpeak what they would prove from hence, cannot be without manifeſt abſurdity and contradiction. As if
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:200329:101"/> the Apoſtle ſhould ſay; Timothy, <hi>continue thou in the things which thou haſt learned and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them: And yet do not truſt</hi> Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>though from the mouth of an Apoſtle, but the</hi> Scriptures <hi>only for your</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, weigh well the words themſelves in the ballance of right Reaſon, and they will eaſily be found too light to carry the cauſe on their ſide. <hi>All Scripture divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired, is profitable for teaching, for arguing, for reproving, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing in Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. True, 'tis ſo, taken collectively; yea, diſtributively every verſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is profitable for ſome ſuch end and purpoſe as is here ſpecified. And what then? Therefore it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to regulate our Faith in all points neceſſary to Salvation, and to determine all Controverſies in Religion. Good God! As if what is profitable for our Salvation muſt preſently be ſufficient for all things required to it. Speak ingenuouſly,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:200329:102"/> is there ſuch a word as ſufficient, or compleat Rule of Faith, or ſole Judge of Controverſies, or words equivalent contained in this Text? Or doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay that Scripture is all-ſufficient of it ſelf to perform theſe Offices without the Churches Interpretation? Becauſe 'tis profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the hand of a Learned Biſhop to Teach, to Diſpute, to Correct, to Inſtruct the Souls for whom he muſt give an account to God; Is it therefore a ſufficient Rule for every learner and ignorant Chriſtian to ſquare and cut out his own Faith by, to interpret and judge of according to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Reaſon, and to compoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Creed,</hi> though contrary to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councils, and the whole Chriſtian World? Does St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay this? Will this Text juſtify ſuch an inference? Yet this he muſt ſay, or this place concludes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the laſt out of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and not the leaſt they rely upon in this Controverſy; I ſhall give a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:200329:102"/> brief anſwer, as ſeeming to me of all other moſt impertinent and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding. For the true meaning thereof is plainly this: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall preſume to add to theſe Divine Revelations any other than what I have already deſcribed in this Book, and endeavour to obtrude them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church with the ſtamp of my Authority to gain credit to them; or ſhall deny any Propheſies herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to be written by me; let ſuch a wretch expect the Vials of Gods Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to be pour'd on his accurſed head, for ſo wicked an Impoſture and Infidelity.</hi> Which being evident, thus muſt run their Argument: <hi>God will ſeverely puniſh thoſe who ſhall add deceitfully, or ſubſtract maliciouſly from St.</hi> John'<hi>s Propheſies; therefore the</hi> Bible'<hi>s a compleat Rule of Faith, and the ſole Judge of Controverſies about Religion.</hi> An inference too groſs to be confuted. Yet from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular premiſes they draw an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal concluſion; and on ſuch weak and abſurd reaſonings from Scripture build their Church.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:200329:103"/>
               <p>But how <hi>Engliſh Protoſtants</hi> will defend their Brethren the <hi>Lutherans</hi> from the wrath of God, I ſay not for diminiſhing, but even taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this whole Book of St. <hi>John's Revelations</hi> from Sacred Canon, I know not. Thus therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there is nothing here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by our Adverſaries that proves evidently the all-ſufficiency of Scripture for a Rule and Judge to decide all Controverſies in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that the above-cited Texts but being throughly examin'd, either conclude not for them, or for us. So much we are beholding to our Antagoniſts.</p>
               <p>To conclude, after an impartial and full examination to the beſt of my Abilities, I finding the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Proteſtaniſm</hi> to be really groundleſs, and built upon meer uncertainties, I forſook it, and my own ſelf, to rely on the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church for my Salvation. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced my own deceitful and weak reaſonings upon Scripture, to believe what the Fathers have
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:200329:103"/> plainly and unanimouſly taught, what hath been declared in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Oeneral Councils, and what hath been delivered by <hi>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:200329:104"/>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall make it appear, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church is highly guilty of thoſe ſins, by its ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church its <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Mother.</p>

               <p>The Church of Chriſt is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Tribunal on earth, a Judicature of Eternal life and death, from whoſe living voice we receive our Faith, and the grounds of it, as is ſaid and proved before.

Hereupon he pretends ſcruples of Conſcience about his Marriage with Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> no leſs then 22 years after their ſolemn Eſpouſals, ſealed with the endearing pledge of Iſſue to ſucceed him in the Royal Throne. And upon his hot Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his new Saint, he grew ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſo tender-hearted in the point, that by all means his former Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage muſt be diſannull'd, that the ſtorm and inquietude in his breaſt might be appeaſed. And forthwith Addreſſes are made to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to Commiſſionate <hi>Legates</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to hear and determine the buſineſs with all poſſible ſpeed. But the Queen appealing from them to <hi>Rome,</hi> by the advice of her moſt Learned and Counſcientious Councel; and the <hi>Pope</hi> underſtanding the equity of her Caſe, and how much it might be endanger'd where the King had ſo much power, accepting of her Appeal, recals the hearing of it to Himſelf; and after mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, notwithſtanding all attempts
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:200329:113"/> and political motives to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, gave it, as he was bound in Conſcience, on the Queens ſide, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King. Which indeed was no more then to ratify what before had been adjudg'd lawful both by the Apoſtolical Chair, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty now perceiving that all hopes were paſs'd to procure from <hi>Rome</hi> a Divoce from his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wife, and Vertuous Queen, (whom he could not but Honour, even while he perſecuted) and a Diſpenſation to Marry his Beloved, he grew highly enraged; and paſſion ſo far prevail'd, that abandoning <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Chriſtian Peace and Unity, he renounces all obedience to the Church, caſts the <hi>Popes</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity out of <hi>England</hi> under pain of death to the Acknowledger, makes himſelf ſole Head of the Church in his own Dominions, and conſequently Judge in his own Cauſe, and then no queſtion all things muſt paſs for him, and an uſurped power would effect what
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:200329:113"/> Juſtice could not: In a word, he Divorces himſelf from his moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Vertuous Queen, ſhakes hands (as I may ſay) with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and joyns himſelf to <hi>Anne Bullen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the original of this fatal <hi>Schiſm;</hi> from this impure fountain ſtream'd a deluge of miſeries upon our ('till then) moſt happy Iſland. For no ſooner had he, to ſatisfy his luſts, remov'd the rampire of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (the ſole preſervative of Faith and Unity) but an inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Evils broke in violently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; and with <hi>Schiſm,</hi> likewiſe <hi>Hereſie, Sacriledge, Oppreſſion,</hi> ruine of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> contempt of <hi>Religion,</hi> by making it lyable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual changes, uncertainties and and confuſions, as ſad experience hath but too clearly manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Thus was the <hi>Proteſtant Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (as they call it) in <hi>England</hi> firſt brought forth into the World, and theſe are the Miſeries which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it.</p>

               <p>It is not the Votes of a Parliament, whom Chriſt never made Church Governours, nor Judges in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in points of Faith; 'tis not the Acts of a National Synod held by a few <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Biſhops, when ſuch Councils even of <hi>Catholick</hi> Biſhops may, and have erred; 'Tis not the conſent of two <hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> plea, that they did not ſeparate from the Church, but were forcibly caſt out from her Communion, and therefore the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is a voluntary receſſion from the Church, not imputable to them, is anſwered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEeing it cannot be denyed, but that the firſt Reformers were bred in the bowels of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:200329:116"/> Church, communicating with her before this unhappy rupture, to wipe off from them the odious crime of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> they lay the fault upon the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church for caſting them out by force from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; whereas <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary receſſion from the Church, and theirs was not, they not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves, but being ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which I ſay firſt, that never were any <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> even whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for ſuch, in any Age caſt out from among the Faithful, by Sentence of Excommunication for their contumacy, but they might with as much ſhow of reaſon uſe the ſame plea for their juſtification.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how can they impute their ſeparation to the Church, when after her utmoſt endeavours to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unity, they would by no means be perſwaded that it was lawful to communicate with her in Doctrine and Worſhip; herein preferring their own private opinions before
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:200329:117"/> the judgment of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, how frivolous this plea is, will moſt manifeſtly appear, if they will but conſider what was acted by themſelves wholly antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the cenſure of the Church.</p>
               <p>That the Church hath juſt Power and Authority to Excommunicate ſuch of her Subjects who deſerve it, is confeſs'd on all ſides. Yea, that ſhe's obliged to cut off corrupted and incorrigible Members from the body of Chriſtianity, (leſt others be infected with their errours,) is plain to common ſenſe. And that it was the practice of the Church in all Ages to injoyn the Faithful to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Communion with thoſe who pertinaciouſly maintain'd a different Faith from her, no man can doubt, who knows any thing in Church-hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Now, when they had voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receded from the Doctrine and Government of their <hi>Catholick</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (or if any compulſion appear'd in the buſineſs, it was not on the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:200329:117"/> Churches part, but from their new Spiritual Head the King:) when they had demoliſh'd Monaſteries, ceiz'd on their Revenues, Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt Conſcientious of the Clergy, Confiſcated the Eſtates of contradictors, and put to death ſome, moſt eminent for Learning and Piety, becauſe they would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their Faith and Conſcience to the Kings aſſumed Authority in Church Affairs: When they had aboliſh'd the publick Worſhip of the Church as Superſtitious and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and caſt out moſt of the Sacraments as prophane and unholy things. when they had moulded a Religion according to the policy of State, and Intereſts of the great ones, who had added to themſelves by taking from the Church: When they had forſaken the only certain Rule of Faith, and made way for innumerable Sects and Subdiviſions, which they have found too true by ſad experience: (God laſhing them with their own rod, that they may ſee their ſin in the glaſs of their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:200329:118"/> puniſhment.) And laſtly, when to fill up the meaſure of their ſins they remained unrelenting and obſtinate in their manifold diſorders, and miſs-called Reformations in the Churches Faith and Diſcipline when they had done and acted this in a moſt violent and head-ſtrong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the wonder and pity of the underſtanding World; and all poſſible means being us'd to reduce them to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Unity, from which they were fallen, but all in vain: The Church then, and not<note place="margin">

               <p>BUt ſeeing there is a palpable <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Church by their new erected Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they cannot make the World believe that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not They, was the dividing party and Actors in this ſeparation; being ſo contrary to the nature and

               </p>
               <p>For firſt, grant that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be but a particular Church, yet as ſuch 'tis a true Member of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; as the moſt Learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> not only grant, but contend for againſt other <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and ſo they could not ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as ſuch, but of neceſſity they muſt ſeparate from the whole, with whom ſhe, as part thereof communicated.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:200329:119"/>
               <p>Secondly, if the ſeparation was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made from the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, let them ſhew us any Body of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> agreeing with their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Church in all Material points of Faith and practice, to whom the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> united themſelves when they made a ſeparation from their <hi>Catholick</hi> Mother. If Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church be pretended, 'tis moſt irrational, when condemned by themſelves in their Belief concerning the Proceſſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Maſs, Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed if they will be of their Communion, they muſt agree with us almoſt in all points wherein they now differ from us, and alledge as juſt cauſes of their ſeparation.

If with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> 'tis as vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, for by the Confeſſion of thoſe who made a full ſearch into the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Tenets, they agree in more points with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:200329:120"/> then on the contrary. And 'tis well known that when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies were hot between the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants,</hi> as <hi>Hereticks</hi> are always as well fighting among themſelves, as againſt the Church) the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> plainly aſſerted, they would ſooner return into the Boſome of their <hi>Catholick</hi> Mother, then joyn in thoſe points with the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> with whom of all other Sects the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> may moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have Communion. Which nevertheleſs hath as airy a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as either of the other, when the greateſt <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Goliahs</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Reformation</hi> condemn the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> of fundamental Errors, in denying <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> and the Kings <hi>Supremacy</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical matters;</hi> and for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from them in other points contain'd in their 39 <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and way of <hi>Worſhip.</hi> And ſo while they ſeparate from the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they

And this guilt will never be wip'd off, 'till it be evidenced that the Chriſtian World is in an

               <p>This is enough to manifeſt the unity of this Plea to any unbyaſſed and indifferent judgments.

For the partition-wall being broken down by Chriſt the chief corner ſtone of this Spiritual building, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were united into

               <p>Secondly, the Church of Chriſt is <hi>Catholick, ratione temporis,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to univerſality of time from its firſt exiſtence; becauſe being once founded by our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 14.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:200329:124"/> though of a diſtinct Communion wholly, and in many points of a different belief from the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally viſible Church. And think they have done enough to prove their Church Univerſal in reſpect of time, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom they ſeparated, did never fail nor ceaſe to be a true Church, though, as theſe men pretend, much corrupted. Which to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is as much as to ſay, that they who are of different Faiths in a different Communion, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, of the ſame Faith, in the ſame Communion; and parts ſeparated from the Body yet actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally continue Members of it. And that a Commonwealth of ten years old may juſtly maintain themſelves to be of a thouſand years ſtanding, becauſe Monarchy, which they caſt out to ſet up their new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, was of ſuch continuance by a viſible ſucceſſion, and agrees with them in ſome common Principles of Reaſon and Government. Who can reſolve theſe riddles? Are not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:200329:125"/> theſe pretty props to uphold the new <hi>Protestant</hi> Church to be of the Ancient <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith:</p>
               <p>Strange! Can men of Reaſon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy their Conſciences in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns eternal Salvation? What is the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church but a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Believers united in Faith, and Worſhip? And yet to hem theſe men in, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt not be as a City at unity with it ſelf, but a body compoſed of Antipathies and Contradictions. Let them ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, will not this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing make <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> or any old condemned <hi>Hereticks</hi> to be Members of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church as well as <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi> did deny but one point of <hi>Catholick</hi> belief, and were caſt out; And ſhall the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who deny many, be kept in, and reputed Members? Shall that abſolve the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which condemns the <hi>Arrians?</hi> For 'tis not denying this, or that, but any point of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Faith with pertinacy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, (though <hi>Hereſies</hi> may be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:200329:125"/> more or leſs malignant and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) that caſts us out of the true Church, and makes us ceaſe to be actual Members of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, can they as a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Communion have a perpetual vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, and yet begin to appear firſt in the World in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the viii. 100 years ſince, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more? Is it any thing to their purpoſe, to produce a viſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Believers</hi> in a never-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion of the ſame Faith with them in ſueh point wherein they agree with the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church, when ſuch points are not thoſe which conſtitute them a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church, but thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ from us? If they will with any ſhew of reaſon defend their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Faith, as ſuch, to have univerſality of time from the Apoſtles, they muſt produce a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Body of Chriſtians in Church-Communion, profeſſing thoſe points wherein they differ from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, and for which they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:200329:126"/> ſeparated from her, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe points and practices in her, which they now do. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to talk of a perpetual ſucceſſion of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from the Apoſtles to their preſent Paſtors, is no better then a ſick mans dream, or any airy <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> without any real beeing or exiſtence.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Puritan-Proteſtants</hi> and many other <hi>Sects,</hi> either not well conſidering the grounds why the moſt Learned of the Reformation defend the Church, of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church and perpetually vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; or elſe plainly ſeeing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of rationally maintaining their deductions thereon depending; in the ſtorm of a blind zeal againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſplit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt another rock, (never caring for perpetual ſucceſſion and viſibility to make them <hi>Catholick,</hi> confidently aſſert) that the Church of Chriſt was over-ſpread with the infernal darkneſs of Superſtition and Idolatry, that it wholly ceas'd to be a true Church for a thouſand
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:200329:126"/> years and upwards, more or leſs, (for they cannot agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the determinate time which gave this fatal period to Chriſtianity) 'till by their bleſſed Reformation the glorious light of the Goſpel did dawn a-new unto the World; and with the ruines of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (hopeful Children to caſt ſuch durt in their Mothers face) they did beautify the revived Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Wherein they wholly agree with the <hi>Donatists</hi> of old, who after their ſeparation from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, thought they could not defend themſelves from <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> unleſs they would maintain that the Univerſal Church was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally periſh'd, and ſhrunk into their new-born Conventicle; which hath in it the the mixture of thus much Truth, that no ſeparation from an acknowledged true Church can be juſtifyable. But this is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that thoſe very men who pretend ſo much veneration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, as to make it the

               <p>After this one <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick</hi> Church was founded in the World, and began to ſpread it ſelf into all corners, the Members of it were called Chriſtians, to diſtinguiſh them from all not profeſſing Chriſt. But when ſome of themſelves aroſe teaching perverſe things to draw away Diſciples after them; and ſo ſeparating from the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of once they were Members, erected new Communions; then thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who ſtood firm, adhering faſt to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:200329:129"/> the Church and Doctrine eſtabliſh'd by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, were called <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch falſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who had ſeparated themſelves into <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi> Congregations. Which if the <hi>Protestants</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider aright, they would never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus incongruouſly. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church is not the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, becauſe it comprehends not Us and others in her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who are Chriſtians: when <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiciſm</hi> in its genuine notion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes an Univerſal Communion of true Believers, continuing in the Faith and Worſhip firſt deliver'd to the Saints, in oppoſition to all <hi>Sects</hi> of Chriſtians divided from it, though never ſo many or ſo numerous. Which ſeparation from a Mother-Church is as manifeſt in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> as in the <hi>Arrians,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Schiſmatical Hereticks,</hi> who might as well have objected to the true Church, from which they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that ſhe was not <hi>Catholick,</hi> becauſe they profeſſing the Name
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:200329:130"/> of Chriſt, and holding moſt points of the Chriſtian Faith, were not Members of her Communion.</p>
               <p>So then, a <hi>Catholick</hi> is a Chriſtian communicating with that Church in Faith and Practice, which was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Which Church, doth evidence it ſelf for ſuch, by a perpetual viſibility and ſucceſſion from that time to this preſent Age: By conſequence he is no Member of any new Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtians, gather'd together by ſome Doctor teaching contrary to the aforeſaid Church and Faith received.</p>
               <p>Neither would there have been any need of adding <hi>Roman</hi> to the word <hi>Catholick</hi> had not <hi>Hereticks</hi> aroſe, denying the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor to be the ſupreme viſible Head and Paſtor of the Faithful; and yet in their divided Communions preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either to be the only true Church, or a part of it.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:200329:130"/> call themſelves <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> to diſtinguiſh themſelves from all ſuch falſe Churches: And a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> is in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of Chriſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles, ſcatter'd over the face of the whole Earth, in Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as ſupreme Head and Paſtor of it. Which the word <hi>Catholick</hi> by it ſelf ſignifies as vertually, this only more expreſly. The Church always being very careful upon emergent occaſions to expreſs her ſelf by diſtinctive marks or terms, ſufficient to point out the only ſafe and high-road to the haven of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; that thoſe belonging to her charge might not ſhipwrack their Faith on the rock of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or be ſwallowed up in the gulph of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> And thoſe who are without might know their dadger, and fly to the ſaving Ark, to preſerve themſelves from periſhing in the deluge of their ſins.</p>

               <p>But certainly, whoever impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſiders what has been ſaid in the precedent, and ſome other <hi>Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> concerning the Churches Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility can never think it poſſible that ſuch groſs errors and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could invade the Church to her utter ruine.</p>
               <p>The Church of Chriſt, which is the pillar and ground of Truth, (and could not be ſo, was ſhe her ſelf lyable to error in points of Faith) hath always been more Faithful in keeping the <hi>Depoſitum</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel intruſted to her inviolate, and unſpotted from all blemiſhes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which unreaſonable men, that is, <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> have endeavoured by all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to introduce, thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the Virgin-purity of Chriſt's Spouſe; contending ſo earneſtly for the Faith once deliver'd to the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:200329:137"/> Saints, that in this Holy quarrel ſhe was ever very liberal of her deareſt blood, willing rather to undergo the greateſt tortures, then it ſhould ſuffer in the leaſt manner. Yea, ſo vigilant and eagle-ey'd hath ſhe been hitherto in the diſcharge of this important duty, that no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Learning, or Sanctity of any perſon whatſoever could introduce the leaſt innovotion in Religion, without vigorous oppoſition and condemnation. As is evident in <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their times; to name no more, being a thing ſo obvious in Church Hiſtory. See <hi>Vincentius Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. ca.</hi> 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Moreover, all points of Chriſtian belief being taught and eſtabliſh'd in the Church by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and as ſuch conveyed down to us ever ſince that time, by Univerſal Tradition, and for the moſt part moſt viſible practice, as the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs, Prayer for the Dead, Invocation of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis altogether impoſſible the

But impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities clouded in plauſible terms ſhall be aſſerted for truths, before ſome men will confeſs themſelves <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> in ſeparating from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and Infallibility muſt err, before they be condemn'd as erroneus, who yet confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Fallible.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe (though it be not true) that the Church was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to errors in matters of Faith; can theſe men, who accuſe her to be erroneous, aſſure us that they err not in the accuſation? For being
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:200329:138"/> by their own confeſſions Fallible, that is, not certain whether what they affirm be true or no, unleſs they can evidence that thoſe are errors indeed which they lay to the Churches charge, no man can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally believe them, ſeeing the publick judgment and atteſtation of the Church to the contrary is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably of far greater Authority, and will overpoiſe whatever amounts to leſs then demonſtration. And in all Juſtice, the right ought to be thought on the Governouts ſide, 'til the revolters from them, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing cauſes ſufficient to juſtify the withdrawing of their obedience, make the contrary undeniably clear to every eye.</p>
               <p>They are the accuſing Party, the Church defends her right; without a definitive Sentence can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. What Judge will they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtand to in this Controverſy? We know they ought to ſubmit to the judgment and determination of the preſent Church, her voice being as it were the voice of God in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:200329:138"/> what is of Faith, or not; and cannot but wonder that they will not alſo acknowledge it, when our Bleſſed Saviour ſays plainly of<note place="margin">Luke 10. 16.</note> Church Governours, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and who deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> And<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 8.</note> St. <hi>Paul, He that deſpiſeth theſe things, deſpiſeth not man, but God, who hath alſo given to us of his Holy Spirit.</hi> But becauſe by her they already are convicted and condemned, and therefore refuſe to ſtand to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, (as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> have done in all Ages) will they refer it to Antiquity, and let the Ancient Fathers give the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? This they cannot rationally refuſe; neither in word (to make a flouriſh,) do ſome of the moſt Learned of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretend to reform the preſent Church, that they may conform to Antiquity, and undertake to rectify the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe hath forſaken her primitive purity.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:200329:139"/>
               <p>But they are at great variance and in diſorder amongſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that they cannot agree when Religion began to be adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and when theſe errors crept into the Church. For being no leſs then damnable errors, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, in things practical and daily in uſe by ſo great a Body, and therefore notoriouſly viſible, and ſpeaking aloud their original, ſeeing they can aſſign no certain time (a task impoſſible, as we have before ſhewn) when firſt they were brought into the Church, 'tis an undeniable argument that they are not innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but of Apoſtolical practice and inſtitution: According to that famous Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin, Quod ubi<expan>

               <p>Some of them allow the Spouſe of Chriſt to continue in her Virgin

               <p>Thus theſe men while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to forſake errors, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Religion, by cloathing the the Church, a new with the ſnowy garments of primitive purity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs unawares, enough to condemn themſelves out of their own mouths, and flatly give the lye to what they produce for their juſtification. They flee to Antiquity to abſolve them
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:200329:142"/> from error, and yet accuſe the ſame Antiquity as erroneous. But while they thus condemn the whole Church, Councils, and Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of errors, certainly they could not intend that their own ſingle words ſhould be of any Authority, or deſerve to be credited by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men. Who deſires more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this particular, I refer him to that moſt excellent Treatiſe call'd, <hi>The Proteſtants Apology for the Catholick Faith;</hi> which in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>ad hominem</hi> is unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and plainly demonſtrates that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt upon their own grounds either become <hi>Catholicks;</hi> or elſe confeſs that their Faith and practice is not the Faith and Practice of the Ancient Church. With whom to conſent, is, notwithſtanding the Plea of theſe men, to defend their ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> their <hi>Catholick</hi> Mother not to be <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some therefore ſeeing their Church not only to totter, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall, while it pretends to ſtand
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:200329:142"/> on the legs of Antiquity, have with greater zeal, though with leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, invented another way to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their <hi>Schiſm;</hi> and will have no Authority at all attributed to the Fathers and Councils, the conſtant practice and Tradition of the Church, for deciſion of the preſent Controverſies; but affirm all things to be uncertain upon that ſcore, though never ſo plainly and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly aſſerted; and the Sacred Scripture independent on them, muſt be ſole judge, and give the deciſive Sentence by it ſelf. Which poſition (if made ſpeak out,) ſays thus much, that ſince the Apoſtles days there's not one ſufficient witneſs of what they taught the World to believe and practice as Chriſt inſtructed them; but that the Doctrine of the Church is to be brought to the touchſtone of Scripture by every one in particular, and after exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be accounted counterfeit or true, accepted or refuſed, as fancy and private reaſon ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. For after theſe magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:200329:143"/> pretences of their great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Sacred Scripture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all to it, this is the up-ſhot, and their Faith is finally reſolv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no ſafer Principle. A Poſition ſo wholly deſtructive of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian belief, ſo inconſiſtent with the majeſtick gravity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſuch a never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dying <hi>Hydra</hi> of <hi>Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> that I know not what can make a ſurer way for <hi>Atheiſm</hi> to triumph over the ruines of <hi>Christianity.</hi> And had our Fore-Fathers been of this judgment and practice, doubtleſs before this time the Croſs of Chriſt had not been the glory, but contempt of Nations.</p>
               <p>Beſides, methinks, they cannot but ſee, that while they flee to to Scripture as ſole Judge in theſe Controverſies, and deny all Church Tradition and Atteſtation, they thereby take away thoſe Sacred Oracles of Divine Truth alſo; when 'tis confeſs'd by all who can pretend any right to reaſon, that there's no poſſible way for us to know un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly what is the Word of God,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:200329:143"/> or not, but by the Tradition of the Church.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if the written Word muſt be ſole Judge, ſeeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves ſend them to the Church, obliging them to ſtand to her determination in ſuch Caſes (as is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid) are they not confounded upon their own grounds, and muſt obey the Churches deciſive Sentence in all Controverſies of Faith, or elſe deny to ſtand to Scripture? In ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable waves do they miſerably looſe themſelves who obſtinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſo bad a cauſe.</p>
               <p>But if notwithſtanding theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogiſms and ſelf-contradictions, the Scriptures muſt ſtill be ſole Judge in the preſent controverted points, and they will have them to ſpeak for them againſt us; except it be ſo convincingly, that the Propoſitions by the very connexion of terms can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed without ſome impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, they are in as bad a caſe as they were before. For if the places produced are juſtly lyable to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:200329:144"/> interpretations, can they think it reaſonable that their private gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould be preferred before the publick judgment of the Church, to whom we owe the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and from whom we ought to receive as well the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when 'tis controverted as we do the Letter? I know in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular diſcourſes they make fine flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and after a long combat with pretended monſtruous errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they clap their wings, and crow triumphantly upon their own dunghill, demanding of their deluded Auditory, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or Scripture is to be believ'd? This is their cuſtom, but 'tis not the queſtion. For let them produce but one ſentence out of thoſe Sacred Oracles of Truth, that in expreſs terms contradicts the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in any one controverted point, for which they pretend juſt cauſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and it would be ſomething to the purpoſe; but who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that <hi>Catholicks</hi> who have taught
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:200329:144"/> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that the Scripture is God's word, ſhould themſelves in expreſs and poſitive terms deny the Doctrine of it.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is (if Scripture alone was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Controverſies) whether the ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in thoſe Sacred Writings, is to be taken upon the credit of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tradition, or new-born inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of ſome few private men; certainly none, except much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway'd by paſſion or intereſt, can prefer the bare conjectures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of thoſe Interpreters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evidence of ſuch Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                  <hi>difficult to be underſtood, are wreſted by the unlearned and unſtable to their own deſtruction.</hi> And the experience of all Ages making it evident, that the Interpretation of Scriptures by private Spirits in a ſenſe contrary to the atteſtation and practice of the Church, hath been the very ſource and fountain of all <hi>Hereſies.</hi> And
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:200329:145"/> in ſuch caſes there's no poſſible way to be ſecured from ſeduction and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into errors, but by firmly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Doctrine and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. <hi>Sine ego, ſive quis alius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If I, or any other</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis) will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the frauds of new-born</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <hi>and ſhunning their ſnares abide ſound and firm in the right belief, he muſt by the help of God fortify his Faith with a double bullwark; first the Authority of Divine Law, and then the Tradition of the</hi> Catholick <hi>Church. For Sacred Scriptures being lyable to ſuch variety of Interpretions, that almoſt ſo many men, ſo many minds;</hi> Novatian, Photinus, Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Donatus, Arius, Apollinaris, Belagius, Neſtorius (Lutherans, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts, Proteſtants, Anabaptiſts, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, Fanaticks, <hi>&amp;c.) every one pretending the Scriptures to ſtand for them according to their ſeveral gloſſes and expoſitions, of neceſſity to ſhun the Labyrinths of ſo many errors, we muſt follow the line of Apoſtolical Writings, as handed to us by the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:200329:145"/> ſenſe and Tradition of the</hi> Catholick <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet if we ſhould exclude the univerſal Tradition of the Church, with the undoubted Teſtimonies of Councils and Fathers of all Ages (by which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> beyond all rational contradiction) from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing to do in the deciſion of theſe Controverſies, granting all that they deſire, let bare words of Scripture be taken according to the exacteſt Criticiſms of private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the judgement of Learned and Un-intereſſed men, and even upon that ſcore thoſe Sacred Oracles of Divine Truth will caſt it clearly on the <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſide againſt our Adverſaries. And if they cannot be convinced from them to be <hi>Heretical</hi> in all material points of Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ from us, yet as much as concerns the formal part of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> they ſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as manifeſtly guilty of thoſe hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſins as ever any one who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Churches Doctrine
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:200329:146"/> and Communion; yea, and by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves condemn'd for <hi>Hereticks.</hi> But never any place hath been produced by them from the Scriptures againſt the Church in the preſent Controverſies, as to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence her in any one point erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; But <hi>Catholicks</hi> have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhown, that by ſuch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they have troubled thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life with the mud of their corrupted fancies, and by injurious diſtortions forced them to ſpeak what never the Holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>

               <p>For it being of Faith in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church, that a Primacy or Supreme Jurifdiction in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal matters over the Univerſal Body of Chriſtianity in St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, (the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>) is of Divine Inſtitution, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by her, as ſo taught, and practic'd in all Ages; yea, and the <hi>Popes</hi> being in peaceable poſſeſſion of ſuch an Authority in <hi>England</hi> for about 1000 years by confeſſion of <hi>Protestants</hi> themſelves, (being a thing not to be denyed, as notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly evident from unqueſtionable Records in Church affairs) to deny ſuch an Authority to be lawful, and thereupon to withdraw their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from ſuch a Government, without any more adoe, declares them <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> unleſs firſt by rigorous demonſtration they prove it to be a meer uſurpation. For 'tis not abus'd Scripture, much leſs other Teſtimonies either juſtly ſuſpected or wreſted to their purpoſe, that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:200329:147"/> can weigh any thing againſt the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of ſo long a continued poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the like to which cannot be ſhown by any Authority upon Earth, to fortify their right againſt oppoſers. I ſay, nothing but rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous demonſtration will ſerve their turn in this caſe, which no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription can evacuate.</p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Papal</hi> Authority was firſt caſt out of <hi>England,</hi> God knows, they were thinking on other matters; Luſt and Self-intereſt had quite blinded the eye of reaſon in King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> and his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, reſolving firſt upon the fact, and then endeavouring to maintain it juſt and lawful. But with ſuch weak Arguments as may be ſtrong proofs to induce all un-intereſted Souls to believe the contrary; though indeed the ſtrength of our evidence againſt them needs no help from the feebleneſs of their defences. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thus liberal they are to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills.</p>
               <p>No cauſe actually working, can but produce effects correſpondent
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:200329:148"/> to the nature of its activity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No man can deny this, but he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his reaſon. If therefore the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy over the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church was introduced by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Corruption, 'tis morally impoſſible that ſuch novelty as an univerſal Uſurpation in matters of the higheſt concern ſhould inſenſibly creep into the Church without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and invade the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World without oppoſition, and this too in producing notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly viſible effects, which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily muſt accompany ſuch an innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Doubtleſs ſuch a change in a matter of pretended Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, would have made a ſtrange clamour and confuſion in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World. One may as well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the bloody alterations of Government in our Iſland, have crept into the Nation, and after the ſad miſeries of ſo long a war leaving behind it evidences to every eye, no man can tell how, or be ſenſible when, and in what manner thoſe grand mutations hap'ned. Yea,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:200329:148"/> this might be defended with more ſhow of reaſon, thoſe alterations being in Temporal matters, acted in a corner of the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more eaſily brought about with leſſer noiſe and better ſtifled in their birth, that they might not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity, then this uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in a Spiritual Government, founded by Chriſt himſelf to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ever, over all the Nations of the Earth, in thoſe things which concern the eternal Salvation of their Souls.</p>
               <p>Thoſe reverend Witneſſes of our Ancient Faith the Holy Fathers, who were ſo tenacious and careful of Chriſtian Cuſtoms, and the Doctrine once deliver'd to the Saints, that they have exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and regiſter'd in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations of Faith or practice which new Teachers would have brought into the Church, and were always more ready to part with their lives than any one point of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would they have quietly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Government of the Church
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:200329:149"/> (the ſole Conſerver of its Doctrine) inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf to be changed, and not generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, contradict, oppoſe, regiſter and publiſh it to the whole World, that they might know it to be a uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urpation, a ſpurious iſſue, no plant of our Heavenly Fathers planting, and therefore to be abominated and rooted out? It is incredible, that they who were ſo eagle-ey'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and eager to contradict mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of far leſs moment; ſhould in a buſineſs of ſuch concernment be wholly ſilent and betray the Truth. For if they have declar'd the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s ſupreme Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Gods Church, as Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Primacy, to be an uſurp'd Authority and of humane invention, and as ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it; let them ſhow it out of their Writings, that we may know when, by whom, and by what means 'twas introduced into the Church, ſo as to invade the whole Body of Chriſtianity. And if they cannot, as moſt certainly they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:200329:149"/> (having labour'd in vain to do't for above theſe 100 years, and their own differences about the time, when 'twas firſt brought in, being a manifeſt proof, it can never be aſſigned, and confeſs'd ſo by the moſt ingenuous among them) ſeeing 'tis a Government that hath been in quiet poſſeſſion of the Chriſtian World time out of mind, with a belief of its divine inſtitution, handed as ſuch to us by Univerſal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs they will diveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of reaſon, they cannot but acknowledge, that, <hi>ab initio fuit ſic,</hi> 'tis as old as Chriſtian Religion; and all thoſe <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey ſo Sacred a Power under the pretence of uſurpation.</p>
               <p>The Divine Right of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy in Spiritual matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus vindicated, thoſe pretences of a Godly Reformation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Church Government to its Primitive Inſtitution, fall to nothing of themſelves; what they call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation being a violent uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of anothers right, and upon
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:200329:150"/> what Motives, is too notorious to be juſtified.</p>
               <p>'Twere much to be wiſh'd, they would lay to heart how in the late Revolutions by Gods moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able judgments on them, thoſe very weapons which they us'd againſt <hi>Papal</hi> Power have been taken up by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to the ruine and extirpation of <hi>Epoſcopacy</hi> for ſome time: And thoſe Zealots in the ſame ſort as handſomely cudgell'd by the <hi>Independants,</hi> all equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a Godly Reformation, and reducing Religion to its primitive Purity.</p>
               <p>Here I might conclude this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my Converſion (wherein I have been very large, becauſe <hi>Schiſm</hi> being a matter of fact is more diſcernable by ordinary capacities, than diſputes of things more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from ſenſe, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is more eaſie to diſcover to all <hi>Seperatiſts</hi> the danger of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they may return to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> unity) eſpecially conſidering the proof wholly lyes on our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries

However, in that many poor Souls not knowing or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtrength of univerſal practice and immemorial poſſeſſion on the <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſide, are ſtill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and kept in error by ſome places gleaned here and there from Sacred Scripture, and the Writings of Antiquity wreſt'd to their purpoſe, that they may evidently ſee that all ſuch verbal proofs from dead Letters are made to ſpeak what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors never intended; I ſhall, <hi>ex abundante,</hi> to give them all poſſible ſatisfaction in a matter of ſo great conſequence, produce ſuch clear Teſtimonies from undoubted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Antiquity, ſpeaking the Faith and practice of the primitive

                  <hi>Euſebius Emiſsenus</hi> expound it, <hi>Our
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:200329:160"/> Lord first committed his Lambs, and then his Sheep to</hi> Peter, <hi>becauſe he made him not only a Paſtor, but the Paſtor of Paſtors. He's therefore the Paſtor of all, for beſides Lambs and Sheep there's nothing in the Church.</hi> And though <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not ſee it, yet St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis plain to all that read the Goſpel, that from our Lords own mouth the charge of the whole Church was deliver'd to</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Prince of the Apoſtles.</hi> Inſomuch that as <hi>Maldonate</hi> hath obſerv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, there was never any Father, <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine,</hi> who ever underſtood or expounded it in a contrary ſenſe.</p>
               <p>So then Scripture-grounds the Ancient Fathers had for their belief in this point. Upon which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures notwithſtanding they did not rely as barely conſider'd in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as ſo expounded by the univerſal Practice and Tradition of the Church, the only Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the written Word, and unerring Rule of <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith. Which being apply'd to theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:200329:160"/> Texts, make them ſpeak clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our belief to any Impartial under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and therefore conſidering the Fathers Faith and practice, they could not be lyable from them to other Interpretations. Of which this is a manifeſt Argument, in that they firſt of all began to expound them otherwiſe, who deny St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy.</p>
               <p>Which yet they cannot do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much injury to the Sacred Texts upon their own grounds. For if, abſtracted from Church-tradition and practice, they be with all their circumſtances impartially weighed in the ballance of reaſon, they very much declare a peculiar power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Church, not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>For here's a promiſe of the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven made to St. <hi>Peter</hi> alone, though the reſt were preſent; <hi>I will give unto thee the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind,</hi> &amp;c. And this ſingular promiſe is uſher'd
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:200329:161"/> in with ſingular circumſtances, all relating ſolely to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviours interrogation, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> making an expreſs Confeſſion of his Faith in theſe words, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God;</hi> our Lord gives him in particular a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Benediction, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-Jona, <hi>and I ſay unto thee, thou art</hi> Peter, Et ſupra hanc <hi>Petram,</hi> alluding to his name (the very name our Bleſſed Saviour gave him when he choſe him to be an Apoſtle; and 'tis remarkable, that<note place="margin">1 Joh. 42.</note> having immediately before called him <hi>Simon,</hi> he now calls him <hi>Peter,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Rock,</hi> of which no reaſon can well be given, but that the alluſion to this name of his by the next words might let him and the reſt underſtand, that he was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deſign'd, upon whom, as upon a Rock, the Church ſhould be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a peculiar manner) <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi> And then follows, <hi>I will give unto thee the Keyes of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. Now put them together,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:200329:161"/> and ſum them up, <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon; <hi>I ſay unto thee thou art</hi> Peter, Et ſuper hanc <hi>Petram, I will build my Church, I will give unto thee the Keyes,</hi> &amp;c. Doubtleſs all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities concerning <hi>Peter,</hi> and none elſe of the Apoſtles, though all were preſent, muſt in all reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to thus much, <hi>That St:</hi> Peter <hi>was to be inveſted with ſome eminent Authority over all the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as St. <hi>Peter</hi> had good grounds from theſe particularizing circumſtances ſolely, relating to himſelf, upon ſo ſolemn a promiſe, to believe and expect that it would be fullfill'd, when the time deſign'd for it by Divine Wiſdom was fully come, by the collation of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:<note place="margin">Joh. 21.</note> So we find in the other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted Texts, that Truth it ſelf was as good as his word, expreſly and by name intruſting to St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Charge and Government of the Univerſal Church, by a Commiſſion repeated thrice, for the greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that the promiſe before made,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:200329:162"/> was hereby fullfill'd; and withall to leave a greater impreſſion in his mind of the dignity and difficulty of the Supreme Office and Paſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, wherewith he only now actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was inveſted.</p>
               <p>'Tis frivolous to ſay they are but admonitory expreſſions to mind St. <hi>Peter</hi> of his duty in doing the work of an Apoſtle, when the words car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as much in their face, an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative Commiſſion, as; <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> ſpoken elſewhere to all the Apoſtles. Let them give any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reaſon why, <hi>Feed my Lambs, Feed my Sheep,</hi> ſpoken by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Juriſdiction to an Apoſtle, ſhould not be an Authoritative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as well as, <hi>Go teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 28:</note> Beſides, had they only been admonitory words to excite St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the work of his Apoſtleſhip, they would have been as neceſſary to have been ſpoken to all the reſt as to him, who were equally Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles with him; and therefore not now minded of their duty, becauſe afterwards they were all to receive
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:200329:162"/> power from above by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, for the performance of that great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work.</p>
               <p>So then being a Commiſſion, and only given to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that he was thereby inveſted with ſome Spiritual Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the other Apoſtles had not, though all Apoſtles. And the queſtion put to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by our Bleſſed Saviour immediately before the words of his Commiſſion, have no ſmall influence to prove a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Power to be inſtated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him above the reſt. For being asked, Simon <hi>Son of</hi> Jonas <hi>loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> Thoſe words of command <hi>Feed my Lambs, Feed my Sheep,</hi> do not correſpond, nor are at all emphatical, as what follows relates to them, if thereby no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority more, or above the reſt, was not imparted to him as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his extraordinary affection, in that he loved our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our more then the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Moreover, in ſhort, as St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:200329:163"/> did profeſs his Faith before the reſt, when this ſupreme Authority was promiſs'd to him, ſo now our Saviour would have him profeſs his love eſpecially above the reſt, when he conferr'd upon him this Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>Thus if theſe places be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to the light of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances, in all reaſon Scripture makes for a Supremacy in <hi>Peter</hi> above the reſt of the Apoſtles. And (as hath been ſhown) the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers from theſe Texts una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly aſſert, <hi>That the Church was in a ſpecial manner founded on</hi> St. <hi>Peter, in being conſtituted <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Head and Paſtor of it.</hi> To which if we add the voice of the preſent Church atteſting it to be a Univerſal Tradition, handed to her as ſuch from Age to Age, the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rule of <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to an Infallible certainty, and puts the queſtion out of all queſtion and further diſpute.

               <p>IT being manifeſt by what hath been diſcuſs'd in the precedent <hi>Motive,</hi> that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> is undeniably guilty of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> in a high manner, by their wilful ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in Faith and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and thereupon the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality and perpetual viſibility of the true Church by a never interrupted Succeſſion of Believers, teaching and practiſing the ſame Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from the Apoſtles to theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent days, have been in ſome ſort handled as points co-incident and con-natural; I ſhall not make any large diſcourſe of them ſeverally, though they did not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to my Converſion, but contract their ſtrength into one Syllogiſm; and ſo proceed to ſhow what effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:200329:165"/> Miracles wrought in the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church, for viſible confirmation of her Faith and Worſhip to come from Heaven, ought to have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Adverſaries, to reduce them to the boſom of that Chuch they have forſaken. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment runs thus.</p>
               <p>The true Church of Chriſt hath Univerſality, perpetual viſibility, and Succeſſion of Paſtors and People, from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time, and ſo to continue to the Worlds end, inſeparably annexed to it.</p>
               <p>But no <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi> Communion of Chriſtians can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be univerſal, or have a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual viſibility and Succeſſion of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in thoſe points which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute them a diſtinct Communion from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, of which they were Members before their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>Therefore no <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical</hi> Communion of Chriſtians can be the true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:200329:165"/>
               <p>That the Minor, or ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition belongs to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> is manifeſt from the former <hi>Motive,</hi> where 'twas evidenced to be <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> and <hi>Heretical;</hi> which once prov'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any Communion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, 'tis implicatory in <hi>ipſis terminis</hi> to ſay, that 'tis, or can be univerſal viſibly Succeſſive from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time; being all one as to aſſert, <hi>That it was founded by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and yet began afterwards by a voluntary ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the true Church ſo founded;</hi> (which is the Eſſence of <hi>Schiſm) and that they were a Congregation Believing, Ordaining, Preaching and Adminiſtring Sacraments, before they had a Beeing in the World: That is, they were, and were not at the ſame time.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, thoſe which wholly exceed the power of created Cauſes in the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:200329:173"/> very ſubſtance of the effect. <hi>As the Sun ſtanding ſtill at the Prayer of</hi> Joſhua; <hi>going back at the requeſt of</hi> Hezekiah. <hi>A mortal body to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as in the transfiguration of our Bleſſed Saviour. Tranſubſtantiation in the moſt holy and dreadful Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs.</hi> Which are the greateſt of Miracles, and in no ſort produceable by the utmoſt Powers of created nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch which tranſcend the faculty of nature, yet not if we have an eye to the thing it ſelf that's done, but the qualification of the ſubject, in whom 'tis done or effected. That is, natural cauſes can produce the ſubſtance of the Miracle, but never in the preſent circumſtances. <hi>As to give ſight to the blind, or raiſe the dead to life;</hi> And does in daily vital productions, but not to one dead, <hi>As</hi> Lazarus <hi>and</hi> Tabitha <hi>were:</hi> And can give ſight, but not to one blind, <hi>As he who was born ſo, cured</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>by our Lord and Saviour.</hi> However theſe being Miraculous only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſubject wherein ſuch
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:200329:174"/> effects are brought to paſs, yet are altogether above the vertue of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cauſes, and ſo as true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as thoſe of the firſt Claſſis.</p>
               <p>The third and loweſt ſort are thoſe which exceed the faculty of Nature; neither according to the ſubſtance of the effect, or ſubject wherein they are produced, but only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner and order of their production. <hi>As when perſons, not incurably ſick or lame in the hands of Artiſts with an ordinary concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſupremeſt cauſe, are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly reſtor'd to health and ſoundneſs without the help of Phyſick, Chyrurgery, or the uſual proceedings in ſuch caſes. And ſo the Apoſtles ſpeaking with divers tongues, which are attainable by time and induſtry in ſubjects capable of ſuch perfections, yet in them was miraculous, in that they being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, were ſuddenly endowed with ſuch extraordinary knowledge and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to the amazement and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their enemies. Of which ſort are alſo ſudden Thunders and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Winds and Storms, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:200329:174"/> and immediate cauſes are not ſo big with ſuch effects as to be deliver'd of them; but rather in all probability promiſing the contrary to the beſt ſighted underſtandings in ſuch matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſuch miracles as theſe, though always produced by a divine power when Holy perſons are the Inſtruments, yet may, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are (when God permits) wrought by <hi>Magick</hi> and compact with the Devil, who can ſo improve natural cauſes, as on a ſuddain to bring forth ſuch effects. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſible to Omnipoteny, and conſequently not true Miracles in a ſtrict and proper acceptation, but in a large ſenſe ſo call'd from the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner of their production; if the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church had no other but ſuch to atteſt her Doctrine to come from Heaven, they could not ſimply of themſelves be ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Truth of Chriſtian Religion, and that the Workers of them are ſent by God. However ſuch wonderful effects, when they Manifeſtly tend to deſtroy the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:200329:175"/> of Satan, invincibly prove their origen to be from the Author of Holineſs. And therefore 'tis not difficult to diſcover when theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are effected by a Divine Power and aſſiſtance, and when by the help of the Devil. Namely, when either the Sanctity of the perſon is ſuch as is no way lyable to be ſuſpected to have any dealing with the Powers of Darkneſs: Or if this be wanting, when the Purity of the Doctrine, as a glorious ray beaming from the Sun of righteouſneſs, is ſuch, that a confirmation thereof in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cannot rationally be thought but to come from Heaven: Or when God is pleas'd, beſides theſe inferior won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to work alſo ſuch Miracles by the ſame perſon, or others profeſſing the ſame Faith, which cannot really be produced by any but himſelf. Of which his true Church was never deſtitute, and no other Communion could ever boaſt, or juſtly challenge.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WHen the infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God is pleas'd to work Miracles in his Church, ordinarily the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he makes uſe of to produce ſuch effects, are perſons eminent for Sanctity. Yet not ſo, as that we ought to make the number or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Miracles the rule to judge of the degrees of their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yea, 'tis not an Infallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to conclude ſuch an one to be a Saint; for the grace of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles being conferr'd upon the true Church, principally for the edification of others; a perſon not juſtified, and ſo not righteous in the ſight of God, may be a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working Inſtrument to ſave his Brethren, and yet himſelf become
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:200329:176"/> a Reprobate. Of which we need no more evident teſtimony then from the mouth of thoſe Pleaders in St. <hi>Matthew; Lord have not we Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in thy Name, and in thy Name</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch 7 22, &amp;c.</note>

                  <hi>Dominos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Our Lord puts us in mind that we may underſtand wicked men alſo to do ſome Miracles, which Saints cannot do. Therefore they are not granted to all Saints, leaſt the weak ſhould be deceived with a moſt pernicious errour, ſuppoſing greater gifts to be in ſuch deeds than in works of righteouſneſs, by which we purchaſe eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now God confers this grace and wonderful power on his Church: Firſt, for the confirmation of the Chriſtian Faith, as his viſible Seal ſet to it, that 'tis true and came from Heaven, as the only means to bring us thither; and ought to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:200329:176"/> as ſuch, by all who deſire to ſave their precious Souls. This is manifeſt from the Promiſe of our Bleſſed Saviour to his Church, <hi>Mark 16. 17. Theſe ſings ſhall follow thoſe that believe, in my Name they ſhall caſt out Devils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues, they ſhall take up Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them; they ſhall lay their hands upon the Sick, and they ſhall Recover.</hi> This is the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>See the performance in the 20 <hi>ver. And they went and Preached every where, our Lord co-operating and confirming the Word with ſigns follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> For ſo the Eyes of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors might tell them the Doctrine they heard was from God, and no humane invention, and therefore inexcuſable incredulous. As in the 16 <hi>verſe, Whoſoever Believes and is Baptiz'd, ſhall be ſaved, but who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not ſhall be damned.</hi> Hence it is, that Signs are ſaid to be for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, that by ſuch evidences of Truth they may be Converted,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:200329:177"/> and all the ends of the Earth ſee the Salvation of our God.</p>
               <p>And this way of Divine atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the wiſdom of God hath thought good to uſe, as moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to our preſent capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſequently moſt likely to produce the effect for which 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For Truth entring into the the cloſet of our Soul through he port of our Senſes; as by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate light of the underſtanding, with an ordinary concurrence of the prime cauſe, man can attain to ſome degree of the knowledge of God by natural effects, and is utterly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable if he does not: So to induce us to the belief of things wholly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and unattainable but by Divine Revelation, he's pleas'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by extraordinary and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural effects, namely Miracles, to work upon our Senſes, that we might believe and be ſaved; or we rendred inexcuſable, when unbelief ſhall be laid to our charge. And therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>

               </p>
               <p>But as Miracles are to beget Faith where 'tis not, ſo the next uſe of them is to give ſtrength and growth to it, where 'tis already planted, leaſt at any time we ſhould have a heart of Infidelity to depart from the Truth received; either by flat <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> which more rarely happens; or by <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> which are Satan's commoneſt ſnares wherein he catches unwary Souls to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. What can they ſay for themſelves, to whom in ſo much Heavenly Light the <hi>Croſs</hi> becomes a ſtumbling-block, ſo as to fall away from their ſtability; or once fallen, if they will not riſe again, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd into the boſom of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church by the voice of ſuch
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:200329:178"/> wonderful works crying aloud after them; even ſufficient to engrave Faith in a rocky-hearted <hi>Jew,</hi> and introduce belief into very Infidels?</p>
               <p>From whence appears the abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that <hi>Protestant</hi> Theſis, <hi>That all Miracles are now ceaſed in the Church.</hi> For beſides indubitable teſtimonies from clouds of Witneſſes enough to ſatisfy any rational man, theſe cauſes yet continuing, <hi>viz. Infidelity, Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> God will alſo ſtill continue the ſame ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural effects to beget or confirm ſupernatural Faith in the Souls of men. But why they are not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as in the firſt planting of the Goſpel, this may be one reaſon, in that the true Church being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the World by thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which more or leſs in every Age are wrought in her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and her's only, entitle her juſtly to all the reſt confirming the ſame Faith, which others cannot claim by the like evidence. For the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end of Miracles being for the confirmation of true Faith, taught
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:200329:178"/> by Chriſt and his Apoſtles to the World, either to give it birth or growth, if God did vouchſafe to work in the ſame manner ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Signs and Prodigies by any perſons in other Communions than his <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, they could not be ſufficient Teſtimonies from Heaven of Divine Truth, but be inſtrumental likewiſe to ſet a luſtre on deeds of Darkneſs, and harden poor ſeduced Souls in erroneous Worſhip. Neither had the Ancient Apologiſts for the Chriſtian Faith rationally made uſe of Miracles as a convincing argument of the Truth thereof, if <hi>Infidels,</hi> or others, could have produced juſtly the like evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to give Teſtimony to their falſe Religion. See <hi>Heb. 2. ver.</hi> 3, 4. St. <hi>Joh. 5. 36. ch. 7. 31. ch. 9. 30. ch. 10. 28. ch.</hi> 15. 22, 24. Hence St. <hi>Gregory, Quia carnales adhuc,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Hom. 2. in Evan.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the Diſciples being yet carnal could not underſtand his myſterious words, he proceeds to a Miracle, a blind man receives his ſight before their eyes, that who underſtood not the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:200329:179"/> words of Divine Myſtery, Heavenly deeds might work Faith in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, God works Miracles in his Church to manifeſt the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sanctity of ſome perſons to whom he's pleas'd to vouchſafe a ſpecial Honour, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes as ſingular examples for others to imitate in their glorious walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And this is done either while they are living, or after death by their Sacred Relicks and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and ſometimes in both they are alike glorified by him who only works Miracles, whomſoever he makes choice of for the Inſtruments. Which no falſe Worſhipers in the World can challenge to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Yet that ſuch have been, and are ſtill wrought by Saints in the Communion of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church, there are as good proofs to evidence it to the World, as that there was ſuch a man as <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> once King of <hi>England.</hi> Which certainty none pretend to deny.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:200329:179"/>
               <p>And though <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot lay claim to any true Miracles for the confirmation of their Faith and practice, yet how fain they would have their new Religion ſo atteſted, is manifeſt in that they greedily catch at ſhaddows, and interpret any thing that's ſomewhat ſtrange and not ordinary, as the ſingular actings of God in their behalf. Or if any among them obſerve ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities in the contempt of worldly Pleaſures and Contentments, (which is ſo frequent among <hi>Catholicks,</hi>) preſently this is a Sanctity without parallel, and by the wind of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory is puffed up to the Prodigious greatneſs of a wonder. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, if all rare things are Miraculous, this among them may juſtly be ſo accounted.</p>
               <p>To theſe I might add the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the riches of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards his Church, by ſuch extraordinary workings, beſide the courſe of univerſal nature, to make up the number of his Elect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:200329:180"/> them in Glory But theſe laſt are not proper to my preſent purpoſe, and the former related rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are thoſe for which God is pleaſed principally to work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the true Church; and ought to be operative upon rational Souls, to bring them to the knowledge, and the embracing of the Truth.</p>

                  <hi>A noble young man by name</hi> Imma,<note place="margin">L. 4. Hiſt: ca. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>in a battel between</hi> Ecgfrid <hi>King of</hi> North-humber <hi>and</hi> Edilred <hi>King of</hi> Mercia, <hi>being left for dead among the ſlàin, at laſt reviv'd, and ſeeking help was taken by the Enemy, and carried to their Governour; before whom counterfeiting himſelf a Countrey Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that brought Proviſion to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, care was taken for him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to gather ſtrength, command
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:200329:186"/> was given to fetter him with Chains, that he might not eſcape by night; but by no means could he be bound, ſeeing no ſooner were they gone who bound him, but the Chains looſed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For he had a Brother by Name</hi> Tunna, <hi>a Prieſt and Abbot, who hearing he was ſlain in the battel, came to ſeek his Body, and finding one very like it, carryed that away for the Body of his Brother to his Monaſtery, where he honourably interr'd it; and took care that many</hi> Maſſes <hi>ſhould be ſaid for the Abſolution of his Soul. By reaſon whereof none could bind him, but forthwith he was looſed. The noble man, whoſe Priſoner he was, began to wonder, and ſuſpecting</hi> Magick, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him the cauſe thereof: Who anſwered, I have a Brother who is a Prieſt, and I know, he ſuppoſing me to be dead, ſays</hi> Maſs <hi>often for me, as if I was in another life, where my Soul might be looſed from pains by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions. This paſs'd on, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly recover'd, he ſold him to another; but what kind of bonds ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were put upon him they were all
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:200329:187"/> looſed; but moſt commonly after the third hour, when</hi> Maſſes <hi>are uſually celebrated, All which he relating to his Brother after his Redemption, his conjectures were found to be real Truths. And many hearing theſe things from the foreſaid man, were inflamed with Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to Pray, to give Alms, or offer to our Lord Sacrifices of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for the deliverauce of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friends. For they underſtood that the ſaving Sacrifice was prevalent for the everlaſting redemption of Soul and Body. This Hiſtory I had from ſome who heard it from the perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on whom this Miracle was wrought, and therefore have inſerted it for an undoubted Truth.</hi>

                  <hi>In theſe days a notable Miracle to be equall'd to thoſe of old happ'ned. For to ſtir up the living from a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death, a certain man, by name</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:200329:191"/> Drithelm, <hi>dead for ſome time, was raiſed again to his Natural life, and related many things which he had ſeen worthy to be remembred. An Houſholder he was in the County of</hi> North-humber, <hi>living Religiouſly with his Family. Whom ſickneſs ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on, and encreaſing dayly, at laſt agonizing, died in the beginning of the night. But reviving about break of day, and ſitting up ſuddenly, the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Watchers fled away for fear, his Wife only, whom love had fixed, (though trembling and quaking) ſtay'd behind, Whom he comforting, ſaid,</hi> Fear not, for I am truly riſen from Death, and permitted to live again among Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: But from henceforth in a far other manner then I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed. <hi>And preſently riſing, went to the Chapel of the Village, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in Prayer 'till day, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his Eſtate into three Portions; one for his Wife, another for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the third, which he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for himſelf, he without delay di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to the Poor, that he might have Treaſure in Heaven.

Both were filled with Souls of men, which ſeem'd now and again to be toſs'd hither and thither as with the horrible violence of an impetuous tempest. For not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:200329:187"/> the fury of the exceſſive heat, (poor Souls!) they threw themſelves into the midst of the inſufferable cold. And when they could find no reſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe Winter quarters, again betook themſelves to the torrid Zone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And yet <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are never the better, refuſing to believe that there is never a <hi>Purgatory</hi> for peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Souls thoroughly purg'd at their departure from their Bodies, though this man and others have been ſent from the dead to teſtify to the World the truth thereof.

               <p>For he was embarqued, and on his way to bring the glad tydings of the Goſpel to our Nation, though recall'd to <hi>Rome</hi> againſt his will and inclination.

                  <hi>Brother, that Omnipotent God hath ſhown great Miracles by you to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom he would have elect. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis neceſſary that concerning this Heavenly gift you rejoyce with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and tremble with joy. You may rejoyce in that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is brought to inward Grace by theſe outward Miracles. But fear, leaſt by reaſon thereof the infirm mind ſhould exalt it ſelf in preſumption; and while 'tis extoll'd with honour abroad, be depreſsed at home with the levity of vain Glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And why theſe Miracles wrought by the ſaid Saint in his Apoſtleſhip ſhould not be evidences, as well of his Miſſion and Doctrine, as thoſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:200329:189"/> accompanying the firſt Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Goſpel to the World, no reaſon ſufficient can be given. This I am ſure of, as they converted <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> ſo they ſtop'd the mouths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the <hi>Britains</hi> who long before had received the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and in ſome few external Obſervance differ'd from him. About which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops and the ſaid Apoſtle meeting to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect unity between them, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments, nor advice, nor entreaty, nor reproof could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to perſwade them to the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> cuſtoms in the obſervation of <hi>Easter, Tonſure,</hi> and ſome other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Rites in Baptiſm; A blind man was brought in, and they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tryal not obtaining of God a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle for the confirmation of their practice; <hi>Tandem</hi> Auguſtinus <hi>juſt a neceſſitate compulſus,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>forced with juſt neceſſity, bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, beſeeching him, that he would reſtore to the blind man his lost ſight,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:200329:190"/> and by the corporal illumination of one. Spiritual Grace might enlighten many Faithful hearts. Hereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the blind man receives his ſight, and</hi> Auſtin <hi>is extolled by all for a true Preacher of the Supreme Light. Then the</hi> Britains <hi>confeſs indeed that they perceived it was the true way of righteouſneſs which</hi> Auſtin <hi>Preached.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I had not ſpecifyed, but that I know ſome <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> againſt all Hiſtory and common ſenſe, derive their Religion from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Britains:</hi> Who differ'd only from the Apoſtle of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and his Converts in ſome few External Rites, which afterward in tract of time they generally receiv'd, and in the <hi>interim</hi> acknowledg'd to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of acceptation, while the freſh wounds of deeply-reſented injuries were the greateſt cauſe of non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
               <p>One more I cannot paſs over in ſilence, becauſe I conceive it ſuch as may much conduce to the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and converſion of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. 'Tis to be found in the Life of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> to this effect.</p>

               <p>St. <hi>Bernard</hi> being intreated by the <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſadly lamenting to ſee ſo many poor Souls ſeduced to follow an Apoſtate, as if he had been an Apoſtle, was conquer'd by their Prayers, and came thither to hinder the further ſpreading of ſo contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an evil, and to try his skill on the infected.

               <p>During theſe his travails in the work of an Evangeliſt, being come to the City of <hi>Sarlet,</hi> the Sermon ended, they brought to the Servant of God Bread to be bleſt and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among the Faithful, as is the cuſtom in <hi>Catholick</hi> Churches. Which he bleſſing in the Name of God, with his hand elevated making the ſign of the Croſs, ſaid, <hi>By this ye ſhall know that the Doctrine which we Preach is true, and the things which</hi> Hereticks <hi>would perſwade you to, are falſe, if your Sick tasting this Bread, ſhall be recover'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A venerable Biſhop preſent, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the tryal, ſaid, <hi>They ſhall be healed if they take it believing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>An Introduction.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom works of Wonder, we paſs to works of Piety, to point out to us the true Church of God; which, though leſs admired, yet are far more precious, as being that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Seed, the Fruit whereof is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory. For we Spiritual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:200329:194"/> cannot come to reſt our ſelves in the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but by walking perſeverantly in the path of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Now, this Holineſs is not to be had but in the true Church, whoſe attribute is not only <hi>Catholick,</hi> but alſo <hi>Holy,</hi> as we profeſs in the Creed, and diſtinguiſhable by it in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from all different Communions whatſoever; who, though they may cloak their deformity with Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal appearances, yet in reality are Synagogues of Satan, having a form of Godlineſs, and denying the power thereof. And the truth is, though by ſad experience I found that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church,</hi> (eſpecially that part of it which I judg'd more pure in Doctrine,) could not lay claim to much Sanctity, ſtill crying down the <hi>Puritans</hi> for meer Hypocrites, whoſe zeal in their way did ſhine far brighter to dazle vulgar eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſuch prejudice I had conceiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by my education in a contrary Religion, that I thought her really Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:200329:194"/> and Holineſs to have no more agreement with Her, then light with darkneſs, or Chriſt with Belial. So that after the Divine Goodneſs, by ſtrowing Thorns in my indirect ways, had made me ſenſible what a bitter thing it is to forſake Him, the Fountain of living Waters, for bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſterns; and had put me upon a ſerious Inquiſition to find out Truth and Holineſs, to follow Them: it was no leſs wonder then ſatisfaction to me, to meet with ſuch heavenly Doctrine, and ſuch holineſs of Life in the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Church, and no other Communion divided from Her: And I plainly diſcover'd, that <hi>Protestant</hi> Leaders could not detain their followers in <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but by keeping them in ignorance of the right Faith and Worſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and laying to her charge ſuch Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices which are not juſtly imputable unto Her. Yet this <hi>Motive</hi> was ſet more home to my heart, when my eyes were made happy ſpectators of ſome of that innumerable Company
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:200329:195"/> of her Members, who in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exerciſe of moſt ſublime Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, live more like Angels then men, though in mortal Bodies. But moſt of all, when our Lord was pleaſed ſo to ſhine upon me with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary light of his countenance, as to bleſs my weak endeavours, in following (though afar off) thoſe <hi>Stars of the firſt Magnitude,</hi> beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying his Heaven on Earth in their glorious courſes. And truly I have from hence ſuch a ſtrong perſuaſion of Truth to be in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wrought in my Soul, that, was there no other <hi>Motive</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm me in the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> my heart very much deceives me, if I ſhould not upon this ſcore rather forgo my life, then forſake my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Faith to become a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> Thus, by the grace of God, this wrought on me; and that it may work on others, I thus proceed.</p>

               <p>For purity of heart is a neceſſary and the immediate diſpoſition to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine union, and according to the degrees of Holineſs in the Soul, this glorious union is more or leſs parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated.

               <p>Now I appeal to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether theſe means of Sanctity are to be found among them, who not only practice not, but deride and Scoff at this ſublime

               <p>And if any doubt whether ſuch earneſt endeavours after Holineſs, and this ſublime way of walking with God, by having <hi>our Converſation in a manner continually in Heaven</hi> while we are on earth be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, if they will be pleaſed to conſult <hi>Catholick</hi> Authors, they may receive abundant ſatisfaction from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Book of the imitation of Chriſt, the Heavenly Writings of St. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> the excellent Works of <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus Granatenſis,</hi> ſo famous for practical Divinity, that ſublime Piece of <hi>Spirituality the Scale of Perfection;</hi> and to name no more, <hi>Sancta Sophia;</hi> for Books of this nature are infinite.</p>

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:200329:200"/> to Heaven, thus ſtraitned for more ſecurity in a buſineſs of higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, by aboliſhing the glory of Chriſtianity under the pretence of Chriſtian liberty: And they eaſily perſwaded themſelves that a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Religion back'd by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power, (as it was in <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> in its firſt Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) and advanced by Temporal Intereſt in impoveriſhing the Church to enrich greedy Courtiers, would over-ballance in Carnal minds the ſtrict Auſterities of <hi>Catholick</hi> Purity: Or, to make the beſt conſtruction of this ſtrange piece of <hi>Reformation</hi> on the Clergy's part, who had a hand in the buſineſs, when they ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would quench the Avarice of the ſenſual King, but the Revenues devoted for ever to the maintenance of extraordinary Devotion, they thought it policy not to withſtand his will, but to flatter him by pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating the matter with ſpecious colours. Eſpecially when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the Rich Biſhopricks, and Cathedral Preferments might be
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:200329:200"/> the better preſerved, when this <hi>auri ſacrae fames</hi> in the Great ones who were ſharers with his Majeſty in theſe Spoils of the Church, could not but be appeaſed by engroſſing to themſelves ſo many Rich and Sumptuous Monaſteries and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſes, the Glory and Envy of our Nation. For I am perſwaded the Clergy in this change were not all well pleaſed in this particular. And I remember a remarkable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Doctor <hi>Jackſon,</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> of no mean note, ſadly complaining in theſe words, or to this effect, <hi>If three perſons in the Sacred Trinity had been as great an eye-ſoar to us as three Monaſteries in every Shire, we ſhould have been as well reformed</hi> Atheiſts, <hi>as reformed</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But whatever were the Motives of ſeveral Intereſts in erecting a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion founded on State-policy, this is moſt certain, that the Subſtantial practice of eminent Sanctity was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd out of <hi>England</hi> at the ſame time with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith.</p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:200329:201"/>
               <p>Neither was the birth of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Church in <hi>England</hi> the death only of ſuper-eminent Holineſs, but its malevolent influence did cool the fire of true Devotion in all ſorts of Chriſtians who gave it any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. For no ſooner had this tree of Reformation took rooting in our Land, but it ſpread it ſelf into arms and boughs on every ſide, plentifully yielding the bitter Fruits of Diſſoluteneſs, Uncharitableneſs, Oppreſſion, Envyings, Back-bitings, Strifes, Ignorance of neceſſary Truths, Curioſity in knowledge, vain and frothy diſputes, ſtaggrings in Faith, Spiritual Pride, contempt of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Authority. Irreligion, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, Sacriledge, Abuſe of Holy things, caſting off the Sacraments, Blaſphemies, Atheiſm; and in ſhort, whatſoever is contrary to true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Evangelical Precepts of Jeſus Chriſt. So bad a tree could not bring forth better Fruits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever once it took ſure rooting, ſo notorious and viſible to the World, that the Arch-reformers themſelves
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:200329:201"/> could not but confeſs it, and to their ſhame and conviction have left it upon record to Poſterity.</p>
